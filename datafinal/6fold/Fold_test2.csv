B00NIYJF6U,1,Within months and only a few uses the camera started showing me a black screen and not taking pictures.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I paid way too much for this item for the Gopro not to work.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I contacted Gopro and they had every excuse in the world why it may not be working.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,What a pain in the butt!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I was overly excited to buy this and very disappointed!!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,For the record It was in a lifeproof case it's entire life!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Barely used in the water!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Maybe gopro hasn't figured out the LCD screen yet.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Pros: -Great video quality -Touch screen makes making commands way easy -Buttons are nice alternative--takes some getting used to--to the touch screen -Lots of filming/photographic options: burst, time lapse, night, etc.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,-Great discount for Thanksgiving!,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"-Came with some mounts -Can sync with wifi and control from app on your phone Cons: -Audio quality when in the housing is not the greatest...not meant for audio recording -Lots of possible settings, need to do homework to figure out what is best for different situations -Box came all dented, but the product was not damaged -App connects via wifi instead of blue-tooth","1,2,6,7",C,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Love this camera!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Love learning to use it!,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great video and audio on this little camera.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I was surprised how small this thing was.,"1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It is smaller than a 3x5' index card, about half the size.",1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I wanted one of these after I saw photos other scuba divers took with their Gp Pro cameras.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I received this as a gift from my spouse with a bunch of accessories.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I'm anxious to use it when I go diving this summer in FL and AL areas.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I'm sure it will live up to its hype and will update my review accordingly.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I plan to use mine for scuba diving, kayaking, hiking and other outdoor activities.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This camera is amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's silly for me to write a review when the bazillions of Videos filmed on GoPros speak for themselves.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's just really awesome having a camera that I can take surfing, skateboarding, biking, hiking, and pretty much anywhere else right out of the box.","3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I've bought a few accessories (you'll want some kind of pole and some different mounts depending on what you're into) but it's really cool just as a rugged camera.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The app makes it easy to upload and edit footage too.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The only gripe I have is that the little cover for the charger input isn't attached (you just remove it completely to access the port) and I'm sure I'll lose it eventually.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Otherwise, this is a solid little camera and I really love it.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Buyer beware.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I used the wifi with it recently and noticed a thumping or helicopter like sound on the audio.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Turns out this is a common issue with this camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,No way to fix it and since I'm past the 1 year warranty...looks like I'm stuck with it.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"If you purchase, you should IMMEDIATELY test it with the wifi settings to see if you can hear the thumping in the audio!",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,battery last less than my previous one,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"As a n00b to the GoPro camera line, I can report that the learning curve isn't too steep and the Hero4 Silver camera takes stunning video with little babysitting required.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"My principal concerns when buying the camera were that the battery life and card capacity would not measure up to advertised performance, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that these numbers are reliable.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I also worried about low-light performance, but obtained entirely satisfactory footage with ISO limited to 800 using ProTune settings (2.7k, 24 fps) in some very poorly-lit interiors of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,GoPro's video editing and importing software is easy to use and recommended.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I also recommend that anyone who buys one of these cameras first checks for firmware updates when it comes out of the box.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I had to update mine.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Luckily, the process is handled effortlessly through the GoPro editing and importing software.",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I am not really a fan of the big LCD screen; with a limited power budget and an easy-to-use menu on the front of the camera, I suspect most users will ultimately turn the rear screen off.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The camera is fine but it has major sound issues when using the wifi.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Check out youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKKLpnLmHg Go Pro is very hard to deal with.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,They make you jump through hoops to resolve the issue,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I haven't had a chance to use my GoPro yet.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I bought it for vacation in Australia and beach time and made sure it was fully charged before going on the plane.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The only time I went to use it on the trip in the beach at the end of my vacation and the GoPro was flat.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Somehow it had switched on in the bag and flattened the battery and I had no idea because I hadn't used it yet.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It was pretty irritating as it didn't get used at all on the vacation due to the flat battery so was a waste of money to have it and not use it.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I thought of using it when I go skiing and attach it to my helmet, but so far I have had issues attempting to do this - the plastic won't separate in order for me to stick it on the helmet.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I'll probably head to REI to see if someone can help me out.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My videos was very choppy.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I did use an high end SDD card, but still a bit shaky.","1,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Returned it.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I have been wanting a GoPro for years.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I ended up choosing the HERO4 Silver because of the night feature and the screen.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I love being able to see the digital picture rather than having to just point, click, and hope for the best.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The case did crask already, which I was a bit disappointed with because I was really hoping for more durability.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Overall this has been very fun to take camping, hiking, diving, and so much more.","3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've already gotten some amazing pictures and with some more time to adjust to the wide angle lense I'm sure they will only keep getting better!,"1,5,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Okay, so the video is great and its a ton of fun!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,My biggest complaint and the reason I say its not worth EVERY penny is the battery life.....seriously under two hours???,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is for people who are outside and active and are going to be doing things like hikes and water sports that can go on for hours.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The minimum should be 5 hours.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Purchasing extra batteries is a money maker where there shouldn't be.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The additional cost of purchasing extra batteries and chargers really adds up.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Not to mention adding addition weight to whatever your activity is.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Especially if you are going on a day hike you'll need this and then a solar charger to keep the charging in rotation.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It would be nice if GoPro had a several hour battery life and all of this was unnecessary.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,That said you will need to buy the battery pack of two as a back up and a solar charger if you plan on doing any activity for more than an hour and 45 minutes.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The touch screen on the back made GoPro finally accessible to me.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The picture is tremendous.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The menus are great.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The one issue I have is the battery life.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It really is far inferior to every other digital camera i have ever had, dating back to the early 2000s.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This doesn't make any sense to me.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"TRIED TO GIVE TO MY DAUGHTER FOR SKI TRIP, HER STATEMENT ' TO MUCH TROUBLE'","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Stopped working on day 3 of an 8 day Hawaii trip.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,GoPro tech support blamed it on a faulty memory stick.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera freezes up even without the memory stick inside.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"This is a known issue, check out the GoPro forums.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Save your self some heartache.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"For the price its not worth it... in low light conditions its not even worth it... for outdoors its just ok.. grainy quality and I just about went through the entire menu to see if I can get better results... Its all about some companies selling you things for the size and portability rather than quality.. stop holding back on the better circuitry and sell it already, not the junky toys.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"My camera started failing after a few shots, it would freeze every x amount of shots and the only way to get it to work again was to take the battery out -something not very convenient when you are diving or doing anything else u are supposed to be doing- and then it started freezeng every less shots, to rhe point that every 2 to 3 shots, i had to take the battery out... so i returned the piece of crap... at that price range, the camera should have at least some basic functions that cameras 8 years old have and work normally.","1,2,6",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I will not buying again from Gopro.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,USB GoPro cable is defective.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This is clearly a returned product.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Spare case screens had writing on them when I opened the box.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,6 months into my first GoPro ownership and I am still very happy with my purchase even in light of the newest model's release.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I went back and forth on whether to spend money on what amounts to be a bit of a novelty, as a non-professional user it is a super fun and pretty easy to use camera that has the durability and small footprint to be utilized in almost every situation that you can film.","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I bought it primarily to do some vlog filming and offroad usage, in vlog filming or capturing dialog the GoPro is far from the best choice.","3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I would say if you are not doing a lot of action shots this camera is better for alternate angles and B-roll footage.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Even though it fell short of my expectations for my primary purchase reason, (mostly due to poor sound capture with internal mic and lack of zoom) I would make the same purchase again.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"This camera, although not the newest model anymore is still capable of doing so much and if you have any desire/interest to make videos your creativity will find a place for this unit in your camera arsenal.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Looking back I may have went with the Yi action cam for cost reasons but as time goes on I feel that the availability of accessories and extra features allows me to have better equipment than my ambitions which is, in my opinion, better than the inverse.","3,5,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I got this as a birthday-christmas gift for myself and I love it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,So far I've used it mainly during winter sports.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Neice and nephews are learning to ski and it's great to get quality video.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They also love being able to watch themselves after the fact.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I defiantly recommend getting accessories and back up batteries as it will just make your experience better.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Shop around before buying...I purchased on Amazon at a good price but found a better deal a week after I got it,"4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,GoPro has always impressed me.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Whether it's their awesome videos or the graphics and frame rates that they can pack into such a small camera, it's always awesome!",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I honestly would recommend this camera over the Black Edition because of the rear LCD screen.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You are able to frame your shots very easily as well as adjust your camera's settings all from the touch LCD screen.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Then when you start filming you have the option to turn off the screen to save battery.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Another thing I would buy is a Wasabi double battery pack and charger.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,this camera is great but filming at high definitions takes a lot of battery power.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Having the extra batteries is almost a must!,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"The only reason I would but the Black Edition is if you really were just going for the improved frame rates at higher definitions, otherwise, this will be more user friendly and give you awesome video as well!",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have Owens a GoPro hero 3 white and now I just purchased this hero 4 this product I awesome you can do so much more and the pic and video are so.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Much better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Yes it is price but so worth it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So much more you can do,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Card Error!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Yes, am one of those persons who keep getting the infamous card error that leads to the camera seizing up!","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"And yes, I have tried different SD cards, all of which were the recommended class.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"In fact, I emailed gopro directly and gave them the specific name of the cards I was using and they replied that those cards should work!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Am still trying to figure out though why only Gopro cameras are plagued with this problem (other cameras may have this issue occasionally but Gopro has seemed to corner the market on 'Card Error').,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Of course what this means is that the sport cam that you bought to capture moments that may be impossible or very hard to get in the future (scuba diving, aerial shots, rock climbing etc.)","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,will have you pissed when you're looking back at your footage and realizing that you got 18 minutes of your hour long adventure.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Moreover, none of the features in the cam (FOV, FPS, Protune etc.)",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,will matter because Card Error will result in you not getting the footage in the first place!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It was difficult to transfer memory.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,And batteries only last an hour - so make sure you have a few,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is a great action camera and can be used in very tight places.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,My favorite part about this camera is the touch screen display.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This feature makes all the settings much more accessible and easier to use.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only problem is the camera will get very hot with extended use.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,There have been reports of this ruining the camera but my camera has lasted so far (6 months),1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I just received my Hero 4 Silver.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have to give gopro a lot of credit for improving the menu on the Hero 4 silver.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I also have a Hero 3 Black, but have always found the menu selections confusing.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Hero 4 Silver has really fixed that problem.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I debated up upgrading, but am really glad I did.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It is worth your time and money to make the upgrade.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Delivery in time, no problem.","3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,But the cam after 1month doesn't work anymore.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Screen was pink, blue, green and now the cam stay locked and no function are avalaible.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Pretty worried with that product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is horrible.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The video quality is better than the 3+ Black.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Unlike the older optional viewer, I can actually see this in full sun but using it drastically reduces battery life.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I haven't had any problems with the unit freezing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The 3 had the same problem after charging via USB/PC so I always use a charger.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3.0,"Of the 3 Black, 3+Black and the 4 Silver, overall I prefer the 3+Black.","4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The battery life is the deal breaker.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,NO complaints.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,this GoPro is amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Used it tons of times and the video is awesome!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"This version is great because of the screen on the back where you can actually see what you are shooting, but when its on the mount on a helmet or whatever, you cant see it anyway.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So much fun!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Even a mundane walk around the neighborhood was fabulous to watch when we got home.,"3,4",,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,POST replacement as well.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Have had this issue since day one; right out of the box.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought this unit in Dec of 2014, and I probably used it maybe 4 times, nothing strenuous: snowmobiling,Ski trip once and now the wifi on this unit won't turn on no matter what I try.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I must give kudos to customer support who really tried to help me out, but without wifi its really inconvenient to use this device.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Did a quick google search and seems like there are many folks like me having the same issue.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The deal breaker with the HERO4 is no image stabilization.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Video jiggles around so much it detracts from the content is so so annoying.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It's going back tomorrow.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,What a shame.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Disappointed that it wouldn't charge but great return policy and ordered the black instead.,"1,7",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"It works fine, except for the fact that it didn't come with a charger, the lens were VERY scratched, the cover for over the plugs, where I would put the charger, is missing.","1,7",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The silver cover is all scratched up and is broken at the top and it stabs me.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I would recommend this product if someone has the time to replace practically everything and will but a battery pack separate.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I would recommend this product for anyone who is willing to pay more to get the GoPro quality that everyone wants.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Good camera; I upgraded from the Hero 2.,"3,5",,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,"Captured dozens of hours of POV/Dash cam in some of the most beautiful scenery this country has to offer, and aside from notable vibration, the images are spectacular.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The vibration is the only reason I didn't give this five stars.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,GoPro needs to build in heavy duty image stabilization for a piece of equipment like this at the cost we pay.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Other than that, the only other issue I had was overheating in the desert-traveling SUV with full A/C on, and battery life could be extended.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I love how they auto-shut off the viewer display while the cam is running, but it should probably have some sort of indicator on the back side that shows the camera is operating.","1,2",R,Feature Request,

B00NIYJF6U,5,totally awesome and you can wear it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I totally recommend it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I like this one better then the black one because it has better functions and he isnt using it for certin things that the black one was for.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Plus in certain weather conditions this one works way better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,If you work in construction or outside where the weather chnages I would get this one.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The GoPro Hero 4 Silver is a great sports/action camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It works best for up-close action and takes sharp video when you can keep it framed steadily on something.,1,P,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,Just don't expect the best landscape or far away shots.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Decided to splurge for my 5 year belated honeymoon to the Brittish Virgin Islands and get the toy that I have always wanted.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I got it it was amazing, I immediately took it out and filmed my dog, took stills, everything worked great, until it started freezing, so I had to power cycle it a few times, no biggie.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I got home I researched the freezing, and even though the SD card i bought along with the camera was recommended I decided to go for the top of the line just to make sure that nothing would go wrong on the trip.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Boy was I wrong, every other time I would try to take a picture it would freeze and I'd have to power cycle it.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Every other time in video mode it would start recording, but only record for 7 seconds and then freeze, completely fooling me and the past 10 -20 minutes of footage that I thought I was filming.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When the camera did work it was great, but at the end of our 7 day vacation, it just sat in my backpack waiting to be shipped back.",1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought the camera 2 days before I left for vacation, so I wasn't able to really see how terrible this camera was going to be.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought 2 of the recommended SD card, ensured everything was up to date software and firmware wise.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I thought this was going to be the perfect beach vacation companion and turned out to be a great paper weight.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"This is quite a common problem with this device, my advice, STAY AWAY.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The 1080/60fps setting on this camera really ends up looking great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The baked in time lapse video settings are amazing, as well as all the variations of timed video/pictures.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The biggest issue I have is the performance in low lighting situations.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The automatic ISO settings end up creating grainy pictures/videos with what I would consider fair lighting.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The night shot mode with increased exposure times, while functional, is also somewhat lacking due to the poor low light performance.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I've tried adjusting various settings in ProTune, but I still haven't been able to really get a good result.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Overall, still a great camera for active lifestyles and easy videos.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Eh,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Only beaten by the Hero 5, on order, the Hero 4 has operated perfectly and without a hitch from day one.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,GoPro should not have killed the use of my beloved wasabi batteries -1 star.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The product description said it includes battery charger and 16gb memory card.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,But I did not find it in the shipment.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I am not sure if it should be a separate package inside the same shipment or if it should be part of GoPro item itself.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Not really a fan of GoPro......bought this one year ago and its overpriced!,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"images from pictures are less than stellar, battery life sucks (on/off just for pictures - won't last a day)(video recording - 2 hours max), and editing images are a pain.....just downloading them from the GoPro is a hassle.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"1080i videos are great, if mounted to car or videoing distant objects.....underwater the images are okay.","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,IMO there are better cameras on the market.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The GoPro Hero5 is probably the same.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Well made with good quality video.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Pricier than others, but I felt confident with the name-brand market leader, since I have friends who own it and are pleased.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It lived up to my expectations, with the exception that some of the options for settings are not clear by their on-screen labels.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is circumvented by a visit to the manufacturer's website.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,love the handfree option so I can take camera shots.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,the drawback is NO zoom,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Gave as a gift.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They seem to like it a lot.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was disappointed in what the GoPro can actually do.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I think it is a super overrated camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Needed to have the absolute best light to take in any color!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Was ok for timelapse of the moon.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This GoPro is awesome.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I took it to Hawaii, got it wet, dropped it, and the quality of the picture was/is fantastic.","1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only issue is the battery life.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It dies quickly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Sure you can carry another battery, but then you yet something else you have to carry and worry about.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I bought this gopro camera to use for an upcoming vacation.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I decided to try it out at our daughters winter guard performance.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"When we got home and hooked it to the HDMI cable that is attached to our LG smart tv to watch it, the video froze after about one minute of the four minute performance.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We called go pro tech support and they informed me that their engineer's were aware of the problem and said they 'might' get the problem resolved in the future.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We were told we would have to record the videos in a lower resolution in order to play it back on our tv.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It is unfortunate to spend this much money on a video camera that will not perform as advertised and have to settle for a less quality video output.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We are not very pleased with what we have found out and just feel it is something that others who are looking at this product need to be made aware of before making their purchase.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've never owned a go pro but purchased one to record some sport related activities.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Recording some volleyball and paintball matches provided fun video and I enjoyed using it.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've given it 4 stars only because the Go Pro's lack of ability to zoom and constant fish eye lense limit it's usefulness outside of action related pov shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Just 3 stars because they come w/a diferent micro usb charger,but any ways it's amazing camera!",1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,3,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I bought this to replace my sealife underwater camera, which I could never get good photos with while SCUBA diving.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,So far am really happy.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I also bought the battery backpack, deep water housing, red filter, underwater stick, and Knog kudos video light.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The camera is great, easy to work, download video, extract stills.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Pretty much everything I wanted.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Not thrilled with the fit of my red filter as it goes over the display a bit, which leaves me a bit blind.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But the quality of film is excellent---can watch it on a big screen TV and it looks great!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Freezes all the time.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,And Sometimes takes lije all-violet pictures ....,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Disappointing,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The screen is nice for framing shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Great image quality and totally water tight (taken it down to 35m so far).,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Big issue: Generally crappy/laggy interface, which I hoped they would have fixed.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"No remote control, unlike the GoPro 3 Silver.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The app connectivity really stinks.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to get the camera reconnected.,"1,2",C,Inquiry,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Eventually reset the camera, which didn't work because I couldn't reset the app.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Then I lost my phone - hardly the solution to that problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Easily gets to 4-5 stars if they include the remote and fix the app.,"1,2",C,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Great camera but after looking to unboxing videos I realized it came out without the 2 extra set of attachments for the case, meaning the one that allows you to have a open screen and the one you could use the touch screen underwater.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I been buying products from amazon for quite a few years so is a bit of a let down.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I would have given this camera a 5 star rating is the use of the camera was a little more intuitive.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It is a quality product, just difficult to learn to use.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I have 3 professional model dslr cameras and they are easier to use when compared to the Go Pro.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The connection between the GoPro camera and the phone app works perfectly ......,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I am happy with the GoPro Hero 4, just a little frustrated by the screens for setup and changing modes.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They are very hard to see in my opinion.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Lots of options but I wish the camera zoomed in.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,We used the camera on working dogs to get a good view of the cattle in working situations but of course the video was too bouncy so my husband wore it and the video was always too far away to really get a good shot of anything.,"1,4,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Quality of the video is good though.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The battery last for only an hour..,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I basically need so many batteries!!,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"After I used the camera for an hour, it just crashes then becomes okay again... And this thing is not cheap you know!",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I've had this item for about a month now..,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I only use it for a handheld gimbal, and the LCD screen has already gone bad.. 5 days outside of the return policy.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Ive never dropped it or carelessly handled it.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Disappointed.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Worked bellow expectations for one year with consistent overheating in the most average of weather.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Continual issues with turning on and off and locking up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I used it as a dash cam, the simplest of labors, but it still managed to disappoint even there with a constant air of unreliability.","3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"And finally, the kicker, one month after my very expensive replacement plan runs out it completely falls apart, with sd errors that make it completely unable to use no matter which sd I use it for.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I spent months researching the best camera for my needs, but I suppose my conclusion was way off.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This camera has been a sour expensive experience since day one.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll stick to the cheap stuff from now on.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,At least they don't make you go broke for their shoddy craftsmanship.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My gopro hero 4 does not connect with my Samsung S6 phone!!!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,When chatting with the gopro team they said it is not compatible anymore!!!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Are u serious?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great Product!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I purchased my GoPro Hero 4 Silver for a winter trip to Montana.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I got great pictures and perfect high quality videos, I wish i would have watched more video reviews to understand the different settings.","1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"But this thing can do it all, and the LCD touchscreen works perfectly.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The LCD is perfect for seeing what you are taping and framing your shots then it turns off after a couple minutes to save battery.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,If I would have went with the black i would be disappointed because without the LCD the GoPro is a little hard to navigate.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The battery works for about 1 hour 30-45min of filming in 1080p by 60 so do buy some extra batteries.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Cant wait to continue using this thing in all different sports and activities!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Â Took it with snorkeling in St John and worked great for me.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I'm happy with the photos and video, which is much better than other efforts.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,(Haven't figured out how to edit the video yet).,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,But the camera is relatively easy to learn to use.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I used an extension stick and floats.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Seeing the viewing screen is marginal when the camera is extended away from you, so make sure you practice so the point of view is what you want.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can see my angle was above the 'tang gang' and the shark surprise!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Adding a couple unedited photos and video.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Water clarity, depth, and sunlight make huge differences.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This is the 3rd replacement Hero 4 Silver camera I received from Amazon in a month.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,All 3 have the same 2 issues.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The all have the wifi helicopter sound issue and they get hot when used.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,So frustrated.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,After 3 months something going wrong and ita not working properly.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,No support from amazon or GoPro.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Need help in order to check what we should do,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love this camera!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The video is amazing and pictures are great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I tested the video on 1080 and 720 and both look great on a large flat screen TV.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I took it in the ocean and pool and the water proof cases worked perfect.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I would suggest getting some of the accessory attachments though.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The one I like the best is the floating handle.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,here are 3 cases and one is completely waterproof and one is more water resistant.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can't control the back of the camera settings with the completely waterproof case.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"With the water resistant case, you can sometimes change the settings, but sometimes not.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"This gopro was delivered on time and place Properly, but the item was not as satisfying as I expected.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I recorded some footage from snowboarding in the mountains which could be bumpy at times and unsteady, but I thought that this camera would solve at least a percentage of this issue.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Although, the gopro presented the footage without a bit of steadiness.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It was clear though!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Received the GoPro Hero 4 silver, with manufacturing defects does not work, to use the recommendation of the manufacturer had to buy a brand Lexar model 633x memory, I was able to upgrade the software and igualmanera still did not work, from the first day the camera it stays in the start menu and does not recognize the rest of the commands, I tried restarting of all forms and the camera does not work, additionally the camera when I arrived note that in one of the corners of the front frame right supeior was broken.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Please I need to be refunded my money, because the article does not work in any way.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If you're thinking about getting the Session or the HERO4 Black, DON'T do it.",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"The session has worse video quality than the two, and unless you really REALLY need a small cube, the Session is useless.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Black is GREAT for shooting in 4k... for 30 minutes before the battery dies on you.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Unless you're planning on taking 10 batteries with you, the Black isn't worth it.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"In addition, the HERO4 Silver has a LCD touchscreen, which (if you're into photography) you can line up shots and make sure your finger isn't in the way.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have taken an entire DAYS worth of photos and videos on the HERO4 Black before realizing I had something in the way.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Save $100 from the Black, and get the Silver  -Sincerely, from a GoPro and REI content creator.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Check out my shots on Instagram if you need examples of the quality.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,IG @joshmalech,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Yeah yeah - can you really not give this 5 STAR - yes.?,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Only I would like that it wasn't silver, hate that make it black or have inserts for color.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I took it for underwater with a Sony underwater camera ($200) which takes good shots already.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The wide angle and underwater expertise made this rule.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,However when deep underwater I got the green tint - sometimes- I guess in software white balance but really it ruined the video and I can't seem to take out that saturation in post.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Fix that for your star GoPro,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The Hero4 Silver is the best and only action cam I've ever used, but it's not without it's faults.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"* The touchscreen is great, but it's resolution and color spectrum isn't.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Hard to tell if anything is in focus or if the colors are good.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,* Switching back and forth between two modes is a pain.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I can see why they added voice-commands in the next version * 2.7K at 30fps and 24 is awesome.,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,1080p60 is a little underwhelming.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,For actual slow-mo you have to go down to 960p.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"* If this camera drops in price a ton with the new release, you won't be disappointed at all.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Current price point though is way too much.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera freezes....,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have to take out the battery and put it back.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I do the same thing three or four times until it works,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,SO MUCH FUN FOR PICTURE LOVERS!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,GREAT UNDERWATER!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,GREAT ON DOGS BACK!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Every picture is flattering since no real closeups.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,No need for photo shopping cause every picture is flattering!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,BEST CAMERA for action.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Strong, well made, so many ways to enjoy it weather videoing in your car traveling, using the harness to attach to pets, its idiot-proof technology that is straight forward : press one button and PERFECT, and last but not least......","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Drum roll please........uploads right on the spot wirelessly to other devices!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,NOW THAT IS USEFUL!!!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,LOVE THIS THING!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Keep getting SD Card error and miss getting vids and pics that cannot be recaptured!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,coooool :),4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Very easy to navigate around the options but one thing I would highly recommend is 'get to know your gopro before your big adventure'.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Watching videos on tips on navigating and how to take selfie shots came in very handy.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I had the camera in the case a lot during our trip with the solid plastic door on it so the only way to get around the options was using the three buttons.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,After a few days of using the buttons I was able to navigate around pretty quickly.,"1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great shots and videos with both medium and wide angles.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Although don't expect the take great night pictures with this, they get very blurry but during the day is a completely different story.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Try it, you'll have a great time with it.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,OBSESSED.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,i take this thing everywhere.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,nothing more needs to be said about the quality and functionality - absolutely amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,one drawback though - battery life is pretty crap.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"have read all the stats on the website about usage times, but find this innacurate in real world use.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"eg: go on a hike - take a handful of of photos, and a few short videos, and the battery is almost depleted.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"always carry spares, but annoying to have to change so often","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I just received it but it looks great and my initial sample videos are excellent.,"1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The packaging is high quality as if you went and picked it up new at Best Buy.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This is my first GoPro and the quality and feel of the camera and accessories feels excellent.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It is nice and small and the fit within the housing is very precise.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I plan on documenting my experience on my motorcycle and enjoying various other activities like the dog park and fishing trips.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Can't wait to put it to use.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Only grip is I wish battery lasted longer.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It appears a fully charged battery will last about 2-4 hours depending on your resolution settings.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Great video quality and easy to use.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I was surprised how good actually.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The only complaint I have is that the battery is so small and weak and the camera as a whole is so small, that it doesn't work well in below freezing temperatures for things like skiing.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The battery dies very quickly in the cold...sometimes within just a few minutes.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera froze the first time it was used after charging the battery, I would seriously consider buying this model - research all the blogs about this unit freezing.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,When I sent it back in I was told that the warranty department had no units available to send.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,now that I have experienced this problem I did some research with people that I saw had bought a hero 4 and a majority of people said they had a similar problem.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Quite amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"So BEWARE, and do some research before buying.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Im an honest guy and I have to say I didn't wanna believe in the bad reviews so I took a chance.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Well for the record I wanna say I got SCREWED big time, Battery didn't wanna charge, When it was unplugged Red light said it was charging.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,If you have an important life event you want to record like I did don't count on this camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,WASTE of time and MONEY.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Youll have better video/pics through your phone.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,100% HONEST REVIEW!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I paid $300 for this camera which seemed to be the norm when buying the hero 4 silver new, but upon recieving the package it looked like it had been opened and resealed.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I ignored it, but after removing the camera from its housing I noticed how horribly scratched up the LCD screen is (picture attached).",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Very disappointed.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"So far the camera itself seems to be working fine, but I feel that it was refurbished and I've paid the price for what should've been brand new.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Quite the amazing device!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This was an upgrade from my Hero +...so you can imagine all of the features I am having to learn.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It was a toss up between the the Hero 4 Silver or Hero 5 and in the end I got the Hero 4 Silver because it suited the needs for which I was going to use it.,"3,4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I am videoing my races (5Ks to 1/2 Marathons for personal accountability and memories) I knew I wanted a gimbal and the Hero 5 is still having issues with the Karma and Microphone placement/sensativity.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I am very pleased with the performance so far!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,This appeared to be a refurbished model.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,From the start it would not turn off and on properly.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It still has functioned well enough for my 11 year old to enjoy it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I only got blurry pics.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Also did was not compatible with my MacBook.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Bought a Go Pro Hero 4 Silver on 5/16/2016 w/ 64gb Sandisk Ultra SD card.,"3,4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Got it last Sunday.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Unboxed the GoPro and installed the memory card.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Recorded some clips, probably 3-4 short clips and took few photos, probably about 5 sample pics just to test the camera.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I got disappointed because the camera froze on my very first use as I preview the shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Did a battery pull to restart the camera because the buttons wont respond.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Quite disappointing for a brand new product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Overall is a good camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,A little difficult to use and goes through batteries fast.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Had some issues with electronic interference that messed up some of my recording but was able to get replacement.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,For giving good video and fast shipping but screen freezing sometimes.,1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Need to remove battery to resolve the issue.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,im wondering if this is refurbished or not coz i chose 'NEW'.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Also, there is a big price difference from gopro website.","3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"If you want fast shipping, i recommend this.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,GoPro Hero 4 Silver Rocks!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"For the price,best in it's class for size, video quality and sound as far as I'm concerned.","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Will record audio in stereo with the optional external mic/line-in USB cable ($20).,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I like it and thinking of getting another one for hunting season.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I also purchased the GoPro Remote control which makes controlling the camera easy plus it will control up to 50 cameras (sweet!).,"1,4,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Record time is OK, about 2-3 hours but do yourself a favor and buy another or two extra batteries and maybe 2 or more 64GB Class 10 or better Micro SD Cards (This camera does not come with a Micro SD card).","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Well, I bought this because I saw some amazing videos taken in Maui and thought it would be fun to make them too!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Which, don't get me wrong, it was.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, the camera kept freezing, which is no fun when your diving or snorkeling or trying to view videos directly from the camera to the TV.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The camera gets hot, freezes and stops working.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I thought I may have a bad one, but when I started researching, I found this a typical complaint from other owners.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I would have tried to return this one to exchange for a new one, but I was on vacation and didn't have any of the original packaging with me to send it back by the 30 days.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Something else I didn't anticipate was the learning curve.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It was a little high for me since I'm not a photographer or videographer, just a little old!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,LOL.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I had to rely on youtube videos and the internet.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The manual that comes with it doesn't really tell you how to shoot movies or to take pictures, but I guess that's true with most cameras.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I just need a class!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Pros: small, takes great videos, HD, good for shooting outdoor activities Cons: gets hot, freezes when trying to watch videos directly through a TV, once I downloaded videos to my laptop, it converted to mp4, which isn't compatible with the GoPro Studio, the camera only takes wide or medium angle photos, large learning curve for me (could be cuz I'm old), so it took some time learning the buttons and using all the different settings.","1,2,5","P,C",Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Freezes up on playback!,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,What a waste of money.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I bought the hero4 for a skiing trip.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Now that I'm home I can't get the hero4 to playback on the tv for more than 10 seconds without it bricking/freezing up despite trying multiple cables, HDMI and USB.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The screen turns blue and then I have to remove the battery to restart it!,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,What a piece of junk.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Playback interface is horrible, otherwise it seems to be a quality product.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is pretty bad.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I ended up using 2-3 batteries per day when the cam was mostly on standby.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,DON'T BUY - until GoPro updates the firmware to support playback.,"2,3",,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,3,They are aware of the problem and still haven't done anything to improve it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Now I'm past the 30d window to return and stuck with a relatively nice camera I can't easily watch.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The best action camera on the market!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It also works a great video camera replacement.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Like: - small and compact - waterproof housing - TONS of settings to get the perfect shot - expandable storage - replaceable batteries - free editing software for Mac + PC - mobile app is awesome for quick posts, edits, and control - new sensor can 'crop' the video image during recording to give a traditional video camera look (instead of the fish eye) - SLOWMO!!!!","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"- great 3rd party support Dislike: - expensive - many relatively inexpensive accessories aren't included standard (standard tripod mount, etc) - accessories are EXPENSIVE (most are just molded plastic) - battery life is wanting.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,1 hour of shooting isn't a lot - doesn't call my parents and check on them,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I dont like the design of go pro.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Difficult to use, and bluetooth+wifi burns the battery too fast.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I rarely review, as most Amazon purchases meet expectations.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The Hero4 Silver does not.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The windows app on my Nokia 1520 WP8.1 is a non starter on either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I am totally disappointed, as my intended use depended on remote.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I have ordered the Smart Remote, which may somewhat suffice.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"If this major shortcoming is repaired, I will update my comments.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I purchased this camera recently to use on my trip to Costa Rica; the quality of the video at 1440 was excellent so I can imagine how much better it is at 2k.,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I easily viewed the videos on a TV using an HDMI cord which I had to purchase separately.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,One of my complaints is that the buttons to operate the camera are very small so I keep on pressing the record button by accident.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I also had an issue pressing the wrong button and kept on changing the camera mode to other than video.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Unfortunately, I did not notice this until after recording time lapse stills instead of a video; missed recording crossing over a rickety hanging bridge to get to a spectacular waterfalls.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm making it my mission to get this right!!!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"(LOL)  My most recently problem involves the GoPro application for the computer (Windows 10 sucks); still working on this issue with the vendor and hope to resolve it soon because otherwise, I will not be able to work on/save my beautiful videos.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Purchased the GoPro HERO4 SILVER as a gift for my son.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,He has had nothing but problems with this very expensive camera.,"1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Freezing is an issue, as well as intermittent issues with not being able to record.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Current issue is it will not charge.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have contacted GOPRO directly and will update once I hear back.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Just wanted to advise against this purchase.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"If you google GORPRO HERO Problems, this is not a remote issue, there are tons of people having problems with this camera.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I spent 3 hours trying to connect the WiFi on the camera to the phone app with no success.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Finally after talking to GoPro technical support they said the WiFi isn't working correctly and I had to send it back.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I might have saved a little money buying it through Amazon, but now that there is a problem, I have to mail it back and won't have the camera for christmas as I planned!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,First off this is a great little camera for pics and the quality is awesome.,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"But having said that I purchased this for video, and it does take the best video I have ever seen.","1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,But people be warned if you think you can take a video of an hour walk through the mountains or of a family get together and then burn it to a DVD you are in for a surprise.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Even on the lowest resolution {video is awesome} you will be way over the capacity of the 4.7 Gig DVD!,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was only able to get about 25 minuets of video to burn to a DVD.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I read a ton of reviews and nowhere did anyone talk about burning videos to a DVD.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I already have an awesome 12MP camera for pictures.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Even when I burnt a 25 minute video to DVD it did not play good on my fancy DVD home player.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,If anyone wants a barely used GoPro Silver and accessories let me know.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,If I would have been able to read about burning it to a DVD on their website or any info in the reviews I would not have purchased it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Shame on you GoPro for not telling people about this.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I bought this in the extreme bundle for 440.00.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Since the camera alone sells for 400 at most retailers, this is a GREAT deal!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"You get the camera, a micro sd card (doesn't come when you buy the camera alone), 3-way tripod, two extra batteries and a battery charger pack (off brand) and the headband mount.","1,4,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Overall it's a great deal for first time buyers who don't have any of the accessories which are a must for this camera.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Everything works well.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I do have to say I've had some issues with charging the battery pack.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It didn't come with an adapter for the wall and it doesn't want to charge on some adapters that I've tried.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Had to send it back twice for various malfunctions.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This camera is garbage.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have posted several reviews and this is the first 1 star rating.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This camera has crashed from day one.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I should have returned it immediately but hoped that we would get it straightened out.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"It freezes all the time, rarely is recognized by the computer when plugged in.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,GoPro support is non-existent.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Go to their site and you will see for yourself.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,My GoPro doesn't suffer from the numerous hardware problems that others have experienced.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It just crashes all the time.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,"Kind of tricky to learn, but works great after figuring it out!",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It takes great still photos.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Bought the GoPro for a scuba dive trip to Mexico.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It worked well through 8 dives to 85 feet.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Video was pretty decent with good color using the WoCase Lens Filter.,"1,5,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Photos were not very good in general.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"On the 9th dive, in a Cenote (fresh water cave) with a max depth of 25 feet the case flooded about 20 minutes into the dive.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Since I was in a cave I could not surface immediately.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"So far, I have been unable to recover the GoPro.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It is sitting in rice.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,VERY unhappy with my choice to go with GoPro for SCUBA.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Makes sure you really want one before just buying what will essentially become a paper weight in you house.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I was skeptical about the video and photo quality until I actually downloaded the files to my phone through the app.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I give it 5 stars for that!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only problem I had was that having the screen on drained the battery pretty quickly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've yet to figure out how to turn the screen off to extend my battery life.,1,I,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I also accidentally put the camera in the wrong mode a couple times (user error.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,haha) so be conscious of that.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Other than that, it was a fantastic investment!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I used it for the first time on a recent trip to Costa Rica.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I went whitewater rafting, waterfall rappelling, hiking, swimming, you name it!","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It beautifully captured my whole experience and I would highly recommend purchasing one.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I replace a GO PRO 3 with this camera and I must say the difference in the quality of the pictures it takes is outstanding.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Lots of great feature too.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I had the Gopro hero 3 black for a couple do weeks and sold it and bought the hero4 silver as it boasted better lowlight capability.,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I used it at our recent trip to Disney and universal and most of my still pics came out blurred and unfocused .,"1,4,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,In normal light pictures look great!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But I was very disappointed in the quality of the pictures.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Video is also great in normal light!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I like the preview touch screen on the back of the hero4 silver.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,What to say about this piece of art.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I entered into action cameras by purchasing a low end alternative to gopro.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,When i must admit it did all it promises (sjcam 4000) it is not close the the features set your get with GoPro Hero4 silver.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This camera is just amazing.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has everything that hero4 black has plus a touch LCD so what else do you need?,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Black has addtional 4k recoding options that silver doesn't but to be honest- there is no limit to how much more you can want.,"1,4,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I own a full frame camera and it just never is enough.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"So, you gotta settle at some point and trust me for the action camera world, hero4 silver is the nissa GTR.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The best with a little lesser price point.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This GoPro continually overheats.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The unit gets so hot that I can't hold it in my hand and I'm afraid that it will start a fire.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Mi gopro never function!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Quite possibly the best purchase of 2014.,"4,3",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has lived up to the expectations and honestly beyond.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I gave it to my boyfriend, on thanksgiving, as an early christmas present bc we had a few trips planned and i thought it would be nice to break it out while we traveled.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Not only has it become an essential on the pack list but it goes everywhere with us.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,While the camera is amazing with excellent clarity and durability I figured a few accessories would be imperative to the quality/variety of photos.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"So far he has loved the Joby Gorillapod Flexible Tripod, CamKix telescopic pole 14' to 40', twin pack of extra batteries and charger, and a spare tripod mount.","1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Next on the list of accessories is the remote - while the gopro app has the option to set burst/continuous/video settings and take a picture it can take a minute to connect and is not ideal for all situations.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Highly recommend this camera - it is versatile.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I plan on gifting one to my father and mother who are less than tech savvy but love the great outdoors and live on the water with beautiful sunsets they look forward to capturing.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So I have been using the goPro Silver for a while now using just about every function it has.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So far I have been really impressed with the quality and recordings it produces.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have recorded video on most settings testing to see which one I like best, 2.7k 30p seems to be the sweet spot for everyday videoing for me.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Lets me crop with stabilization and downscale to 1080p and still have a crisp picture.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have used the nightlapse a few times  and have had good results after playing around with protune.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,In the picture settings I have used timelapse to make a few motion lapse videos and they have actually turned out pretty good as well.,"1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,However you you are doing just a regular timelapse I would use the new video function for it and shoot in 4k.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,One thing I would say to new buyers buy the Wasabi extra batteries and charger combo for 19.99 (at the time I purchased) and a external battery pack for longer shoots.,"1,4,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Trust me 1 battery is not enough.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"unfortunately I am not a huge fan of GoPro, this is my second product from them and I have found you are simply paying for the name, nothing more.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Took terrible pictures unless it was perfect lighting and on some forum of tripod.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Video was fantastic though.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The product didn't work, and I had to return it.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The GoPro HERO4 Silver is my favorite GoPro so far.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Built-in screen makes this the perfect recreational camera for those looking to get better photo and video with less effort.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Battery life is comparable to most of the other 4s.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have taken this to the beach, river, skiing, overseas, and just out on the town with friends.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for my professional video work and for personal keepsakes with my family and friends.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The two best accessories I bought for this were the production mount and the Wasabi Power Battery 2 Pack.,"1,5",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Gaining added recording time and always having a spare battery makes the camera much more valuable.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love the ease of use with the updated GoPro app and the functionality of the high res video and time lapse features.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The battery will not charge no matter how many troubleshooting steps I follow!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery duration is very poor specially if wifi is enabled to connect with a goPro app or the remote control.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,I've had the hardest time with this camera freezing up!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I have friends with previous models and he doesn't have this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I googled and it's a common issue no good fix for it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's a very good product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, it's high time GoPro reduced its price.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,There is a lot of good competition at one-third price that cannot be ignored to remain in the market.,8,,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,Batteries last about 2 hours of filming which I found to not be an issue with the extra 2 I got in the package.,1,P,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,Had this for a year+ now and must say I continue to be impressed by the quality of the shots I get (given it's size and lens).,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have a couple of DSLR bodies and lens - both capable of HD movies - but this GoPRo is my 'goto' choice for movies.,"3,4,5,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It is also my goto choice for wide angle shots (what it is built for) and of course, I use it when I will encounter water that would kill my DSLR's.","1,5,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Got a great movie of a waterfall - from the bottom on a boat - even though I was getting drenched.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The only negative is the 'sparsity' of buttons - even thing is controlled by 3 buttons and that takes a bit of getting used to.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,But it is pretty much required by the waterproofing.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I also use it for 'candid' street shot photography with a belt or shoulder strap attachment.,6,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,Before purchasing I went back and forth contemplating this one and the Session model.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Even at twice the price I think it was worth it to get the HERO4 Silver.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The back screen is great so you can actually see what you are recording.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Not to mention the kids always want to see themselves so the playback function is really nice.,2,,Information Giving,

B00NIYJF6U,4,I read others' issue and saw that calling CS helped them out... Maybe they got sick of all the returns because when I called they gave me a long list of requirements I had to do (recording video and send to them) to prove I wasn't lying.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,In the end I just decided that I don't even care about the audio from my GoPro so wasn't worth the red tape they were binding me with to get fixed/replaced.,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,I had a gopro hero 3 for 2 years and I decided to upgrade for the gopro 4.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It came today and the wifi side button is not workng and also the charger usb is not working properly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Being used to GoPro from the beginning, this is par for the course.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's a damn good course to be exact.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's  hard to grade this since all GoPro cameras work great in the latest generation.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,I have purchased several knock-offs previously and now I wish I had paid for the GoPro to begin with.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Clearly many features that give this camera a big advantage.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Only issue is the attachments are plastic and cheap.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Be careful or you will loose the camera.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The camera is of pretty good quality and does the tasks I need it to do.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The editing software however is horrible.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It continuosly crashes during trimming videos wasting my time over and over.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It is very frustrating.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is horrible.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Ordered this because I bought a new 2016 Toyota Tacoma and one of the selling features of the truck was 'go pro ready'.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Which amounts to a plastic mount in place on the windshield!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,What a gimmick.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,Returned it and another one came very quickly.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The time it took me to set up the first one, package it to send back, coordinate with UPS and then set up the second one ... and it won't hold a charge either.","1,4",C,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,!,8,,,

B00NIYJF6U,2,I would put up with it if the pictures came out better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It just doesn't seem like they used a good image sensor.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I am sure it's a great camera for action videos, but again, I just need something small that takes great pictures, and the Hero 4 isn't it.","1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I will say that pictures come out slightly better than on my Polaroid Cube.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Something else that irks me is the fact that despite a bazillion accessories out there, there is no way to attach a lanyard to the camera if I use it without the waterproof case, which I don't need, and which would make the camera too bulky.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I think I will return it for the above stated reasons, even though I love its small size and Wifi when it works :(","1,3,4",P,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,It's not a good camera to take night photo.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"Has yet to fail me on my travels, i especially bought this for my ocean trips.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I like to constantly stay doing water activities and long drives where I do not have to keep an eye on the camera.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"The smaller versions do not carry a screen , but this one does and it helps a ton.","1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's always good to look back at what you are taking instead of taking a wild guess and regretting it later.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Must have for the adventure type or who like to capture video memories.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can also set in in video and photo mode so it does both at once.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Use a 128gb sd card so that you do not run out of space.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Worked fine for the first couple uses, then as soon as I put it to the test in the heat of the day and shaky conditions, it decides to freeze and not function.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Had to remove battery to restart it, now the screen has different colored lines going through it.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I'm going to sell it to a pawn shop and buy one with a warranty, since the seller offered zero and little to no real return policy.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I love my GoPro, but the helicopter noise is simply not acceptable.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It has been widely reported and GoPro still hasn't fixed it yet.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We're in the Maldives for our once in a lifetime vacation and our brand new GoPro HERO4 isn't working!,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We tested it out twice before leaving for our trip and it started freezing up as soon as we landed in the Maldives.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,":( Thankfully our hotel has internet, so we tried all of the troubleshooting steps on GoPro's website to no avail.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera freezes up even without a SD card inserted, so we believe it's a bad camera.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We reached out to GoPro support with a detailed email of issues (including the fact that we're using one of their recommended micro SD cards) and that it freezes up even without a SD card inserted.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"GoPro support responded with 'From the information you have provided, I would say, not for sure yet, that the problem is your SD card, can you please send us a photo to check which one you have.'",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Seriously?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We bought the GoPro specifically to take underwater footage of our scuba adventures here.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Now we have nothing to document this trip we've saved up for/planned for the past 5 years!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,So disheartened.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,:(,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,My first GoPro.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Haven't tested underwater but any video or photo I've shot I've really liked.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Changing settings on the touch screen is easy; I can't imagine the difficulty with other/previous versions that don't have that option.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Speaking of options, that's one downside I've found.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,There are many (for a novice) to choose from.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I find myself missing or delaying moments because I'm trying to decide what video or photo mode to use.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I understand I'll learn with practice but to me the GoPro's appeal is it's ability to capture 'in the moment' and I think I've missed some of those while fiddling with 'super-wide at 1080p 60fps or medium 1440 48fps?',"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,type decisions.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I use my camera with Wifi on, there is a pulsing audio sound captured in the recording.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,A quick Google search reveals this was a widely known problem by that GoPro was aware of at least a year before I bought by camera.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It has been 18 months since I bought my camera.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Today is the first time I used the Wifi and I discovered the problem.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Even though it's past the warranty period, I'm going to submit a warranty claim to GoPro.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I'll update my review if they make it right and fix my camera or send me a new one.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"If they won't take care of what was a known issue before they sold me my camera because I didn't submit a warranty claim within 12 months, I'll never use their products again.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It's a shame because I was happy with this product until I found this out today.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is a great video camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The film quality is pretty amazing as you can tell by all the other reviews.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only issue we have are that the sound capture is not great if you have the case on and it is mounted.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,You tend to get lots of squeaking in the joint area that can make the sound suck.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I guess that why all the Go Pro videos have music added to them.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Also this is not that good for still pixs.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,We tend to go back to our Iphone for still pics.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Works somewhat as promised.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Takes great pictures and videos.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Mounts to just about everything I'd want it to.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Has serious problems syncing and staying synced to my iPhone 6 plus.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Syncs immediately the first time, then refuses to sync after either phone or Hero4 goes to sleep.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Must go through extensive turning on and off to get it to start working with the iPhone again.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"NOT GOOD when I'm in the middle of skiing, bicycling or hiking.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The last thing I want to do is tech support.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,This is the only way I can tell if I have it pointed at the right elevation.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I took video of an entire bike trip with the camera tipped too far down because the GoPro would not sync with the iPhone and I couldn't tell how it was pointed.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Its ok.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery drains fast.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Also didnt come with gopro cd like other gopros do.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,My dad ordered his gopro from amazon and still got the cd even tho it wasnt listed.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Took this baby on our overseas vacation and it worked great!,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,We have great underwater videos and action photos/videos.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's durable, light, and easy to  carry everywhere.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Tried to use as an indoor camera in low lighting and found out that wasn't the optimal condition for this camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Definitely an outdoor camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It came with a head mount and chest mount that we didn't really have a use for.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Bought a separate monopod for the GoPro which we used 90% of the time.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love that you can preview the pictures and videos and delete unwanted pics/vids before wasting time uploading them.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It takes some great fisheye videos and yes the battery sucks.,1,"C,P",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm sure you read this elsewhere.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,What annoys me the most is that it uses USB mini instead of micro.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Now it's another cable to carry around.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Open the camera connected it to my phone.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera tried to install latest software over WiFi but was not able to install.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Called Go-pro for help and was assisted with a manual install that did not help.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Go-pro then wanted me to complete the warranty and replace the unit I had.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I am returning this product if this is my first introduction to their product and it could not work then I do not want to own this.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Love it so far.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Square lens had some dust on the inside which I noticed after taking a few sample videos and pictures and viewing them on the computer.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Took a Q-tip and cleaned dust out the best I can without removing the square housing lens.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Better but not perfect like it should be.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Camera without housing is crystal clear.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Would have given it 5 stars if quality control was better for the housing.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,May be a defect in the flat glass.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's unbelievable how much is packed into this tiny camera... Technology is really something.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, GoPro dominates this market and thus can charge whatever they want.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"At this price point, you'd expect your gear to not freeze up regularly, batteries to last for more than a few hours, etc... 4 stars simply because it is a great product...","1,2,3","C,R",Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But GoPro needs to do better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Because of difficulties in sending the camera received on Wednesday 15 April.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Following the instructions of the camera, loaded the battery and put the micro sd 32 gb class 10 brand Samsung.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera turns on but the screen does not transmit anything from the lens and when menus are manipulated application hangs and does not respond, so you have to turn it off or remove the battery.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I need to know how you will resolve this issue me because the product is under warranty for one year.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It was acquired by Amazon according to the order No.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"109-0544668-4118645, which was delivered to the warehouse in Miami, USA.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,on 13 January.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The order indicates that the product is sold by: Amazon.com LLC.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The manufacturer Gopro already been reported under Case #: 01202790.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"After receiving response procedure to solve the problem, could change my opinion and product qualification.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The battery was not inside of the gopro box, so I couldn't take any picture","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Way too much hype for this camera.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Mediocre at best.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"What is there to say... it's a GoPro, it's awesome!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Yes there are much cheaper options available out there that are advertised as similar, but if you're serious about shooting quality videos spend your money on this.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I prefer the LCD touchscreen so the silver was the best option for me.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The option to control your GoPro through the phone app is really neat too!,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Stupid camera battery dies in 1.5 hours usually, have to keep switching them out all the time.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Also some of the video I recorded got randomly corrupted by itself, even though I was using expensive memory cards.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Bought this for my hubby for Christmas.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,He loves it and took it on a fishing excursion.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Big plans for use for fishing trips.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The head mount allows for almost hands free operation.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Set up seemed easy and he was up and running with little difficulty.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Photos and videos are fantastic for such a small camera and will transfer to your iPad or iPhone via bluetooth.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great for the techie!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Pros- The GoPro Hero4 Silver produces some great video for an action cam.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Its great resolution and frame-rate options will satisfy beginners (me) and experienced shooters.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The built-in touchscreen makes previewing and reviewing and changing settings a breeze.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can get the app and use it as a remote when it connects to the gopro.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Cons- It still needs a housing to be waterproof and the battery redesign means you can't use your old batteries and battery life will still be too short for some especially when you keep the touch screen display on (it drains the battery even more).,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,No option for in-camera digital image stabilization.,2,C,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Over all I am happy with the purchase and the handy new features including a touchscreen, makes it one of the best little action cameras around.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Loved the idea of videoing my trip to Boundary Waters, but camera got damp (not wet) and hasn't worked since.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Not sure what to do about it.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Shipping & packaging were fine,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,New to Go Pro and was excited to get the camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Just received the camera and out of the box the touchscreen had 25% dead pixels along one side of the screen.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Will return through Amazon, hope for the best with the replacement.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"So far not impressed with the quality control of the product,",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Having nothing but trouble with the WIFI, Amazon won't take it back, I may have to fight about this one","1,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I purchased a new GoPro.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This came in a package that had been open and package torn and very worn on the corners.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I sent it back immediately.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Great product, my only concern is the waterproof housing isn't 100% waterproof.","1,3",I,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Still awesome would recommend it to everyone.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Best when purchased with the smart remote and go pole.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I did a ton of research before buying this camera and was aware of the many reports of the hero4 silver freezing and becoming completely unresponsive.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"It seems from the reports I've read, that the solution in every case was to ship thing to gopro under warranty and they replace it and maybe you will get a good one.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I thought just maybe I would get a good one since they have been out a while now.... Nope.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,nothing but issues.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My SD card is officially supported and is one of the fast cards you can buy today.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Rather than jack with shipping back and forth and dealing with the hassle of that whole mess, I just returned the dang thing to Amazon and went to my local Best Buy to get one and hope for the best.","4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Well, the one from Best Buy has tested great so far.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I guess it's just a roll of the dice with this model.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I figured if i got another bad one it would much easier to just go back to the local store.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,top latch broke in a month of light use,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Video is great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"But if you take photo, the photo quality is really not as good as I expect.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I think the photo quality is worse than my Galaxy Note 4.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Considering the high price tag, I give it 3 stars.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"(BTW, GPro stock is only $12 now.)",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Does everything I want and need as advertised.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Doesn't replace a point and shoot camera for getting landscape shots, but excellent for action video, wide angle landscape shots, selfie shots, and time lapses.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Gopro editing software leaves a bit to be desired but the camera is exactly what you expect.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have had it for about 6 months and have taken it on my dirtbike helmet for some trails and fields, strapped it to the exoskeleton of a buddy's off road vehicle for some river trails and rock climbs, put it on the dash when we rented a car overseas and got some sweet time lapse video, and carried it on several hikes and a few other adventures.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Wouldn't have been able to do most of these with any other camera.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,LCD does make framing easier.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Though it sucks the battery down fast,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Clearly not a hero 4,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Love this thing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for scuba diving with red filters.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"What I like most is I no longer spend time getting the perfect shot, I just take a video and crop a picture out of the video.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It makes diving much more pleasant for me and my dive buddies, no more kicking coral or separating from the group.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"You don't need an extension stick, just get a hand held wand.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I am a pilot, and I am using it to video my flights.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It is costly for a camera, and low battery life, and somewhat more complicated than expected, but getting past that, a handy tool for filming activities.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Very choppy,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Delivery was prompt but prior to even opening up the standard plastic housing, I could see a scratch over the lens area.",7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,After opening up the housing I could confirm that the scratch was on the camera lens itself - and it was a deep scratch.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Either GoPro lacks proper product inspection processes or it had already been returned and they tried to pawn it off to an unsuspecting new buyer.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I didn't need to buy it online so I'm wondering why I did.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll return it and buy one from a brick & mortar retailer where I can visually inspect it first; probably a good practice for all pricy electronics.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I returned the Hero 4 Black and got this one instead.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The battery life is still not the greatest but this camera has the Built-In Touch Display (hint, reason why the Silver is not great on battery life), which makes it 100 times easier to use than the Black version.",1,"C,P",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The display is very easy to use and pictures quality is really nice.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I still think these GoPro cameras are over priced but I like this one a lot.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Cannot wait to use it for snorkeling in South Florida!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I received the camera a couple of days ago and was happy with the condition, that is until I charged the product and turned it on.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera kept freezing on me and has glitches on the images.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Just think about watching snow on a TV and that's what you have with the screen display.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Not happy with this purchase at all.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera worked perfectly for 4 months, then it freezes and you are not able to take pictures.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have purchased two different microSD cards from the Gopro recommended list and updated the camera firmware.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Really disappointed with the product and the worst is that I have missed really great shots during different trips, because the camera simply freezes.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I LOVE the Hero4 Silver.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I had a GoPro Hero but wanted to upgrade to something a little better to take to horse shows and on trail rides.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It is perfect!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have taken it swimming, to multiple countries, and on some wild adventures.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has held up with 0 problems.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Just remember to save battery life by turning the LCD screen off.,"1,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I will be purchasing a second one soon!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"First of all as an owner of old Hero 2 series, this new series is beyond compare.","4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The challenge was to chose between black and silver edition but now I am very satisfied with my choice for silver edition since; - Too much investment needed to play and edit 4K films and I am not quite sure whether the difference between 4K and 1920x1080 is that significant especially if there is no TV and/or monitor capable of showing 4K - Silver edition very slim and its back built in LCD panel is perfect and for black edition you have to pay another 80.- USD,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Won't work with any of my micro sd cards and didn't come with one.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Worked for 2 months and started freezing.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Now i am dealing with GoPro support team for an exchange and missing out on capturing the moments for which i paid this money.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I bought the GoPro Hero 4 Silver and I have never been more disappointed in a product!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera keeps freezing up even after updating the firmware severally.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I send my complaint to gopro and they have asked me to send it back for an exchange only problem is that I am in Nigeria and I will probably be charged AGAIN for custom fees.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I wish I didnt buy the damn thing!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Don't make the same mistake I did!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Battery Life and Remote are problems Camera and video seem to fit my needs, but the battery life is only good for 1-2 hours not much use if you want to capture something on film that may not happen right away and don't bring extra batteries (think of a fishing trip).",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The wi-fi remote is terrible as far as charging holding a charge 1 star or lower if there were such a rating.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"My experience with the remote has lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 and could go lower depending on GoPro's technical support, I guess I find out what kind of company I'm dealing with soon.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Buyer beware.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,For many this camera freezes up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I used my successfully 1x and the next time that I wanted to use the camera, it freezes and will do nothing.","1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I followed Go Pro instructions to try and solve the issue and no success.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Be sure to check out Youtube videos on the number of people who have had this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It is a great little camera if you do not get a lemon.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"If you do, you are stuck with it if out of warranty so be sure and get the warranty rather than be out $400.00.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have purchased two of these cameras and neither one of them worked for external audio.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have a drawer full of microphones and microphone adapters and none of them work.,"1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I recently purchased a Drift ghost S it has a 3.5 mm microphone Jack on it no need for an adapter I do not know why GoPro can't build their cameras the same.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The video is excellent though but not being able to run a microphone into my helmet is a problem for me.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I purchased the GoPro HERO4 Silver for my wedding videography business at the beginning of the wedding season.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I was reluctant, because I had heard mixed reviews and I wasn't sure how it would fit into my business necessarily.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I decided to give it a chance, and it was one of the best business decisions I've ever made!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"This camera is an absolute blast, and something that I've recommended time and time again to friends and family.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We use several HD cameras while shooting wedding footage, and I was concerned about the quality of the GoPro not stacking up..",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I was pleasantly surprised, and to be honest blown away by the quality of this compact camera!","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We've had a great time with it, and utilize it for the difficult shots!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,We've also recently started handing off the GoPro to members of the wedding party to take on the dance floor to capture some dancing footage!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We would have NEVER dreamed of handing off our equipment, but the GoPro is so indestructible we feel confident we can share it!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Our clients love that we've started doing this, because it adds a great perspective and we love that clients feel comfortable using the camera!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's so user friendly, we never have to explain it to anyone!",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,They generally just have a sense of how to use it right away!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I've used the GoPro on several hikes, kayaking, and on various adventures!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I'm so impressed by this company, and I would love to have 5 more GoPros!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I would recommend this to parents wanting to start their kids off with a great / fun camera, serious adventurous looking for a camera that is up for the challenge, photographers, videographers, filmmakers!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Basically, anyone looking for a great investment and something that will hold up!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's a tiny camera, but incredible power!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So impressed!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Good for underwater photography, OK for video.","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The case does not have a eyelet for securing the lanyard found on the red lens (used for better colors when diving) which seems bizarre considering how much this thing costs.,1,"C,R",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Hence the outer case needs some work.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This will not go into night mode automatically when going from outside a wreck to inside the wreck...a costly lesson for a Gopro noob like me.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I got this a few days before an overseas diving trip and the printed material provided is kinda crappy.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Yea, I know go online...well in a developing country that is easier said than done.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I simple sheet explaining basic functionality would have be great, but the Gopro gerus don't think so.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They would rather spend money on fancy packaging.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Go online...yea try that overseas.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It works good on land as well.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"It takes okay photos, but nothing spectacular.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Lack of zoom is disappointing.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Video is great, as is the underwater capability.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I only gave it three stars  because the outer case scratches EXTREMELY easily.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I've had several sport-type underwater cameras over the years, and never had one that looked so bad after one week of use.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I am a casual snorkeler, and it was in a case when not in use.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,There is no way a 'sports' camera should look this bad after a week of light use.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love this thing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I was really reluctant to buy one because I am not going to strap a camera to a bicycle or my head or anything like that.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for the family and I am very happy.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The size and video quality is great and I carry it almost everywhere.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If I have any complaint is that if you want to use it outside the housing, it is not well protected, and it is easy to accidentally get finger prints on the lens.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I bought a metal protective housing that includes a UV filter and lens cap that makes me feel a little safer.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Again, I am really happy with the product overall and will most assuredly buy future models.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,What to say about these cameras...The video quality is really good as we can see everywhere in youtube and having a display really helps fine tune the camera position.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,As the display  turns off after 1 minute it won't drain all the battery.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The only con is the sound noises caused by the camera shaking inside the box, it could have something already installed out of the factory to avoid these shocks so I wouldn't need to worry about putting something in there to fix it.",1,"C,R",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It just doesn't fell right to install rubbers and sponges on a brand new camera case to have any chance to use the sounds captured by the Hero4 Silver..,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The good thing about gopros are there versatility.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Built in screen is great in this!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,4k is only fps so just think of it as no 4k.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I always film at 1080p at 60fps.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Having the appropriate mounts and cases for your use are important.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I would spend ~100 additional on those and extra batteries and charger.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"to take filming to the next level, get a feiyu tech g4 gimbal.",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Everything is there, except for the waterproof housing even though it was advertised under the features and details and was also shown in the picture.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Needs image stabilization badly, End up with the Sony version because of this.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Picture quality was ok.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Product gets very warm when using for some reason.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is not great.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I can see the appeal for some with this product, but it was lacking some very key features found in comparably priced products,","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I love my Go Pro, just wish the battery lasted longer and had a flash.",1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Make sure your computer can handle the high resolution settings, otherwise you may not be able to watch your videos unless you record them with the 720 setting.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Most newer computers can handle the 1080P just fine.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Older computers, not so well.","5,8",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Hi GoPro team, I'm really sad because my camera was damage since the first day.","1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I could take some photos, not good at all because the camera began to be blocked, the screen was black and the buttons didn't work.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I had high expectations because I was going to use it the first time in a trip but it was a bad experience.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Would it be possible to have a support contact to fix it or have a new camera or have my money back.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Please let me know any comment or a photo or video as a support.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My mail is dca134@gmail.com Thank you!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Diana Ariza,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I bought the GoPro 4 Silver with the idea in mind that I was buying the best camera of this type available.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It turned out that it's a nightmare to set up and just didn't deliver on picture quality.,2,C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Note that this camera only downloads wirelessly, that's one point not made in all the tutorials and advertisements never mentioned.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The GoPro App download was different for different iPads I had, and totally wrong for one of them.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Couldn't connect wirelessly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"In general, I can't recommend buying this camera to anyone who can't spend two or three days messing around with it to get it to work...and maybe a few more days to get it to work properly...if at all.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was so stoked to buy a GOPRO camera because they are supposed to be rugged.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Well I wouldnt know because I havent taken mine outside yet and it is already broken.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I started to get these pink lines in the LCD screen and then it just freezes up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,You have to remove the battery to turn it off.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I figure no big deal its brand new I'll just send it back.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,When my new one arrives it is doing the same thing after about 3 hours.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I am now waiting on my  3rd camera in the mail.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,GOPRO has excellent tech support and sent me a new camera right away so we will see what happens next but.... All I can tell you is that make sure you get a micro SD card from GOPRO's recommended list.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The speed of the card is very important.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'm not sure if my card corrupted both cameras (which i have never heard of before) or if I got 2 faulty cameras so far.,"1,4",I,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I ordered a new sandisk extreme 64 gig card to try with my new camera.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Fingers crossed.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Not that it really matters.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,the vacation I bought this camera for came and went a month ago.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Before you buy this camera Google GoPro freezing problems....,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'm not the only one with this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll update this review to let you know how it all plays out.,8,,,
