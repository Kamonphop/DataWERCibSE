B01DFKC2SO,3,We have had some issues with the Nest and the Echo Dot not working together when it is supposed to and there are times when it just doesn't recognize commands even though we've don't tons of voice training with the device.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I also find it mildly annoying that you can't just ask a question like,  'Alexa, what sound does a whale make?'",2,,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,4,It's fun though.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Paired easily enough with the Alexa app on my phone and my Bose Soundlink II bluetooth speaker.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Not as comprehensive in it's answers as my Google Home, but it's much easier to ask Alexa to tell Harmony to turn on an activity than it is to say 'Hey Google, tell Harmony to turn on...' in exactly the right inflection to match my initial voice pairing.","2,4,5",,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,4,Or at least my z-wave/zigbee networked house.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,I didn't see the value in it and wasn't too impressed with its audio and picking up voice (had to repeat commands or questions).,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I decided to get the dot since it's cheaper.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The good: its smaller and can use USB power.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Audio is loud enough and can plug into your home audio system, car, Bluetooth speakers.",1,P,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,The 1st one died in 3 months and I did not buy the insurance on it.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I contacted Amazon and they said they'd send me another echo for $49 which I totally balked at.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I told them it didn't make sense for me to spend $49 for another one when the first one didn't even last three months!,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,After much discussion an Amazon customer service supervisor agreed to send me a replacement at no charge.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Kudos to Amazon for standing up for what's right.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I was offered the echo debut price of 99 a long time ago and held out until the 2017 prime day deal on the dot.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The dots speaker is great, I was very surprised actually.",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"For a single room, listening to podcasts, or music even, it beats the portable bluetooth speaker I had been using.",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I would say that if you are thinking you are going to need a bigger speaker, get the dot first before you purchase a speaker to see if the dot alone meets your needs.",1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I will be pairing it with a new speaker because I'd already scored another awesome prime deal, but for other rooms in the future where I would like additional dots, I don't think it's necessary.","1,6",C,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"It drops from the wi-fi a lot,,,, some things such as finding stores is pretty cool and playing music .......... it's ok - nothing super exciting but can be helpful.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I absolutely loved my Echo dot until I realized there is ZERO security and anyone within range can connect their phone to your device via Bluetooth.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I live in the city and countless people are always within range of my device.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"It is pretty neat, but could use a lot of work.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It only uses Bing to search, I ask for it to play a song, it's not in my music library, so it won't play, when normally I can Google or you tube and have it play.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I ask for the weather in my town, but since my internet provider is based out of a town an hour north, it gives me the weather for that town, and I can't set a default for my actual town that I want the weather for.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,That's just a few minor annoyances I have noticed so far.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,Right now we use it for voice activated music and to power some smart devices — so not much.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,I was expecting some type of app or program for the PC to enhance the echo and i got a poorly designed web page based app that is hard to navigate and offers limited interaction with the echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,You can not even make the most out of Amazon music unlimited because the music program does not interact with the Echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,You would think a forward thinking company like Amazon would have the foresight to cover all of its customers options equally.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Amazon if you read this not everyone in the world lives their life dictated by an expensive cell phone that is basically a under powered small computer.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Echo is a home entertainment device not a portable speaker that should require a cell phone.,"1,2",O,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,5,My gripes with the system are that I seem to have to switch back and forth between the mobile Alexa app on my FIre and my PC based one account management options depending on what I want to manage or setup--this is likely a user issue and not a system issue.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,4,I would buy this again.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,"Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.","1,4",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Other than that failure, I've loved having it!",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"The only thing that might annoy someone is that if you say anything with the word 'Alexa' in it, then it responds.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Trying to tell someone about it while on the phone necessitated leaving the room when 'she' took off talking!,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It was quite funny & in time I'm sure we'll remember to not do that & how to use it more effectively.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I like the random info it gives & while we intended to use it mainly as a clock/radio, we regularly ask for a joke, put together shopping lists, to-do lists & set timers.",2,,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"But in the meantime, we're having a blast with 'Alexa'!",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,was not very good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Had trouble to get it to work and it still is not very good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,If I had to rate in on a scale of 1 to 9 and 9+ being to best  I would give it a 3.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,You know all of the other things you can do with the Dot/Echo so I won't run them all down.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I was surprised that with the Dot, you still have a small speaker it is sufficient to hear Alexa's responses to your queries.",1,C,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"I've found that using it for anything else is more work than it's worth, at least for me.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's about 90% reliable so I have reasonable confidence that it'll do what I want.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Anthropomorphizing machines to make them more personal is an annoying trend.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"Most of the time, it does what it's suppose to without overdoing the embellishments of simulated conversation.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I have an Echo dot positioned near my computer where I watch videos and listen to music so there are a lot of false triggers.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Most of the time it just turns on and beeps off but sometimes it talks back saying it doesn't understand.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I wish it would just turn off instead of saying something.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's great for what it is.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,A cheap entry level solution into a 'home assistant' or whatever you want to call it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My recommendation is to hook it up to another speaker so the sound quality is better, as it is a truly terrible speaker that's built in - I'm sure as a reason to buy their more expensive models.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Seems to work good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My only real complaint is that it has a few false positives, sometimes responding to the TV if audio says anything remotely close to 'alexa'.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Granted you can change the trigger word to something else, but it's just worth noting.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Definitely not as flexible as Google home in terms of responding.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Quit working after 3 days of use.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"If you're thinking about whether getting this or Google home, I suggest you getting the later.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Google home has much better potential then Alexa, and doesn't look cheap","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"This is overall a good, quality product.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We use it almost exclusively for alarms and playing music off of spotify playlists.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"If you have the volume cranked, she may have trouble hearing, but this is typically not an issue.","1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Pros: Great alarm clock/timer Plays spotify playlists easy for the kids to use Shopping list is nice Cons: Skills are not quite smart enough yet Siri has more answers for things Ecobee control is not intuitive (as are most specialized skills) I would definitely buy this again, and I am thinking about getting more for the house.","2,4",,Information Giving,Define both pros and cons
B01DFKC2SO,4,The convenience factor is way up there and it looks great.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Used it often when first set up for 'specifically requested music.',"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Of late, haven't used it as much because of switching to DirecTV and listening to its music channels.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Granddaughter loves the Echo Dot for her favorite music and to answer her questions.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Probably would use it much more if it was connect to other devices and systems in the house.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But if you are concerned with 'privacy' you may not want a device in your home that listens to audio in the room and tracks what is being said.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Funny how many of those with 'privacy' concerns post their entire life on Facebook for the world to see.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Great price for a cool gadget.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Has limitations though.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Can't answer detailed questions but knows the basics.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Also, it's annoying when Alexa responds even when it hears it's name from the tv or on a youtube video you may be watching.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Plus it will only play songs you've purchased or have uploaded into your library.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,At $40 though you should have one on every level of your home.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's a great alarm clock and reminder.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Worth it!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Sounds like a tin can, terrible compared to the Echo, I regret purchasing it.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Just placed an order for another Echo to replace the DOT.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The DOT will probably be a gift to someone I do not like very much.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Sound is not great for music, perhaps the Echo itself is better.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You also cannot sync and voice command with your iTunes library on your phone, only Amazon Music, Pandora, SIRUS XM, and a few others.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It got on a Prime Day deal, so i guess the $35 was worth it, but i wouldn't have been happy if i paid more for it.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I'll rate again at a later date as i've only used a few weeks and haven't ordered from it yet, only asked weather, and controlled music.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I purchased this in July (2017).,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It is now September and my Echo is now malfunctioning.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I can give it a command to play my music, but after that I cannot give other commands and I am told by the device to try later.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Within 20 minutes, it stops playing my downloaded music.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Any attempts to rectify the problem is met with a swirling red light and advises me to try later.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I have tried to reset it with negative results.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Sound is ridiculously low but Alexa is very smart,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Here's the basics.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use.,1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Not for every day use.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"We don't shop that often, so the usefulness of this device is limited to a voice activated radio, a trivia game, a hard of hearing person who you have to repeat your question to just for the answer to be incorrect.","2,4,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"The dot was a deal, but I would wait until Amazon has better programming for Alexa, or buy a Google home.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Horrible and useless after initial novelty wears off  Has not acquired any new funtions or learned from use.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Another great product from Amazon.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The only downer is the speaker doesn't pick up from more than a few feet away but I didn't buy it for a large room so it's perfect for what I wanted it for.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Update:  I'd really love it if Amazon would allow multiple devices to stream their music, because this can't happen I will not buy another Dot or even an echo.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Which is too bad because I had plans on buying one for each of our kids in their rooms since they love to listen to Amazon music.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I love my echo dot - it's a great price point, inexpensive enough that I don't feel guilty buying it.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I use it the most for time, timers, stopwatch, weather, shopping list, music and to find my phone.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bad move Amazon.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If (when) google voice provides an entry price point for their Google Home line, the only advantage Alexa will have is ordering off Amazon.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,OK ~ I give up!!!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,can not get it to work.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,we have the full-size echo and hooked it up just fine and enjoy it.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"this dot, however -- cannot get it connected.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,i'm not the most tech savvy... therefore enlisted my brother-in-law AND son on different occasions... and neither could get it connected.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,any suggestions will be appreciated.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"otherwise, going to return.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,thanks ~,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I ordered this in January and have enjoyed listening to news each morning.,"2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"After 4 months, it started re-starting randomly during play.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Now, at less than five months, it won't respond.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I have tried unplugging it, then re-plugging it back in.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It starts up, says Hello.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"When I start a request, the blue light comes on, but turns off after about 1 second, before I can complete my request.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I am disappointed that it started with problems at 4 months, and now doesn't work at all.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I bought the Dot thinking I'd be able to play music from the Dot through my Denon receiver with Bluetooth.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I erroneously assumed this would pair with the Bluetooth receiver, as my research showed that both have the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and should, therefore, have been compatible.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"However, the Dot would not pair with the receiver.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The guy I talked with in tech support confirmed that they would not pair, and said Amazon should change the description to reflect that a device may support the A2DP profile but still not pair.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"In order to pair my phone with my receiver, I had to enter a pass code into my phone.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The Dot does not have the capability to do that.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bottom line is that the Dot doesn't pair with any of my devices.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I had to do a work around by plugging a stereo mini plug into the headphone jack on the Dot with split RCA plugs on the other end into the audio in jacks on the back of the receiver.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Not exactly ideal, as the Dot has to remain near the receiver.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,My Amazon Echo Dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Gets worse the more it is used.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Even after a hard reset, it works terribly.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Buy Google Home instead.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Grabbed this li'l thing during a sale.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Been wanting one for the bedroom so I wouldn't have to continually haul Alexa to and from the living room whenever I wanted to chill with her.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's certainly convenient in that respect.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Only two things that kinda bum me out about Dot are: a) the sound quality isn't even close to as nice as her big sister, which I suppose is to be expected from a smaller unit, and sounds akin to the quality of my iPhone's built-in speaker.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,b) I can't have both Echo and Echo Dot streaming the same music/media simultaneously.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's gotta be one or the other.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Was really hoping this would work, so that there'd be a seamless stream of music from one room to the next as you walk around the house.","2,6",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Ah well.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Other than those things, we still really dig her.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,She now sits on the nightstand and has since replaced our iPhone alarm clocks to wake us with a better variety of alarms (the Top Gear guys wake up call is my personal fave).,"2,3,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Bought 4 of these speaker isn't loud at all..,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I thought...what could go wrong with a 90 day warranty.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,My unit started to make a buzzing noise when connected to external speakers.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Unit was 7 months old.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Get the warranty extension.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Customer support spend an hour trying to help me until giving up.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Was angry enough with my stupidity for having a 90 day warranty - but the alternatives are not quite there yet.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Could not connect to my wifi waiting for my daughter to help,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Hard to set up: it took more than an hour because the app couldn't coordinate the bluetooth or the wifi, kept crashing or hanging.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After restarting the echo, phone and app multiple times, a google search showed that sometimes some part of android needs to be updated for the Alexa app to work.","2,3,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I didn't have that problem but it still took another 45 minutes to set up.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The alexa app is the worst.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The echo is ok as speakers go, though the bluetooth is frustrating and iffy at best (it once took me an hour to connect my laptop to my Echo because neither the app or the echo could 'find' the computer's bluetooth).",1,"C,P",,
B01DFKC2SO,3,It's also super annoying (and not totally clearly stated) that it's not possible to link Echos (or dots) together.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Why does all of the Amazon stuff stink?,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Fussy, hard to use, finicky.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The gear from the big G just works and is totally drama free.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Quite straightforward - gives me news and music when I ask.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Sometimes it overhears conversations not intended for her ears.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"For example we were talking about dialling 911 in an adjoining room, and Alexa, taking this as an order, started to do so without being asked!!","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,There should be a cross check by Alexa saying 'Do you really want me to dial 911?'.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,That would only add a couple of seconds to the response time.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Matthew,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"lots of bugs, glitches and problems that the company cant seem to keep up with.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"lots of developers experimenting on the skill market without trying the skills, effectiveness first.","2,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I got this and the Google Home when they just came out.,"4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I keep the Echo at my parent's house and the Home at my apartment, and use both with smart plugs, smart lighting, Logitech Harmony, Nest, Bose Soundtouch, etc.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After a few months, I can say with certainty I absolutely prefer the Google Home, and think the extra money spent is worth it.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"PROS: - LOTS of skills, including the TP Link smart devices, which work well - Asks for voice feedback and has voice training to ensure it understands you - Can work with an awesome speaker, like Bose or Sonos -AllRecipes integration, though should work better CONS: - Voice recognition isn't there yet - everyone in my family gets mad at Alexa.","1,2",P,Information Giving,and Human Usability
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You  say 'Turn lights on'  and it starts playing Sara Bareilles..... -You have to ask very specific phrases, whereas if you tweak the phrasing in Google Home, it still knows what you're talking about - A lot of the awesome, obscure skills, but even without account integration, you need to enable them and remember their names.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Alexa, ask WineBuddy to''.",8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You need to remember all the specific commands for them to work All in all, for $50 it's good - but I'd recommend waiting for it to improve or trying another device.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it!",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"We also like the 'skills', especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the 'tight pants' song lyrics which is a family favorite.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Overall I am happy with it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Cannot train it to understand my wife's accent.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"She' takes only a little time to get used to, but the set-up did not go well the first time I tried it.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The instructions need to be more definitive on what to do and when.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"That said, the sound quality is absolutely incredible given the very small size (on a solid surface).",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The response is very accurate although I did try to search for a composer who shares a name with a country and western singer so when I said, 'play all by…' I got the wrong person until I specified '…by composer …' I very much like the change of color in the top light ring when she is asked for something.","1,2,4,6",O,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,5,My kids love it to check homework (Alexa is GREAT at math!,"2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"), and play games such as 20 questions.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It is small and non-intrusive with your home decor.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"This purchase is for a Christmas gift - my father quizzes Alexa whenever he is at my house, so this is for him.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I highly recommend Alexa- specifically this small Echo Dot - and a small bluetooth speaker to use it with.,"1,3,5",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"While I have two and an Echo, I would love to exchange them for the Google variant.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Alexa is not good, it is not improving as I'd expected and other than consuming Pandora, TuneIn, and Amazon Prime music I use it to turn on WeMo switches, but that's it, don't expect anything else.","2,5,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,3,UPDATE 2: Sound and operation is better face down.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Bought this product and was not the easiest to set up.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I used it for a week and then tried taking it to a new location and it would never turn all the way on (always acted like it was still 'booting up') so I thought if I took it back to where I originally had it that I would work..,"2,4,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I was wrong.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"However, this product was very useful while it worked.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I'm happy enough with the product, but Amazon lost two stars because they made too many assumptions.","3,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I had purchased this as a gift using Amazon Prime, but it didn't even ship for two days.","4,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Days after giving it to the recipient (already late), I noticed in my Alexa app that the new Echo Dot had automaticallt been registered to my account, but it wasn't intended to be mine!.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After all, it's a voice controlled device so the app isn't needed unless you're making changes like adding a Wemo.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I might not have noticed this for months!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I hope this wasn't the cause for problems he had setting up his Echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,He asked me for help setting it up a full month after I have it to him.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Wonderful little device (alexa, ask for a fart)  This device is full of endless fun and resources.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Out of the box it works wonderfully but as you gradually add in or enable various skills you will find this device to be extremely handy.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy) My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Example: Alexa, whats on my calendar tomorrow?","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Alexa: You have an appointment with the eye doctor at (long pause) 30 pm.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,5,This is my 2nd Echo Dot as my 1st one freaked but I had the warranty so it could be replaced.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I haven't had any issues with this one other than it did come on by itself one night and said it couldn't find the answer to the question I had asked.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The house was quiet and I hadn't said anything so that was a tad freaky.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It made me jump a bit and say a word that is similar to poop when it started talking!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The other thing is there are numerous commercials advertising Alexa now days and if the TV happens to be up loud enough my Echo will come on upon hearing the Alexa name and then it is confused about the question it was asked.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If I can, I quickly place a rag, small pillow or blanket on top of it or try and hit the TV mute button when those commercials start to keep that from happening.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,There are so many different things that can be asked of the Echo and a ton of music to choose from for it to play as well.,2,,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,1,I can't use it in Brazil.,"3,4",,,

B01DFKC2SO,1,Did not like this item....have replaced it with google which I have not put into operation yet.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Most of the questions that I asked Echo were responded to with 'I do not know the answer to that question'.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I would then ask google on my phone and I would get the answer.,"2,4,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It did work properly turning off my lights and giving time and weather....,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bought this for my teen-aged daughter.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"She was very excited, until she found out that she needs to purchase monthly services for everything she'd like to do with the device.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I think Amazon needs to be very clear up front that things like music must be purchased and that other features require special set-up which also cost money.,"3,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Also, after I purchased this Dot through Amazon, I saw it on sale at several stores locally for $10 cheaper.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Not happy.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Love my echo bought the dot for my bedroom.,"3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Now I wish I had just gotten another echo for the bedroom.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The dot does not hear me when I'm standing right over it.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Infuriating to get it to work on a basic command.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,My echo works great.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,This dot is just garbage.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Too late to return it.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Guess I'll wait for the regular echo to go on sale and replace it with something that works.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I shouldn't have to yell a wake word at something I'm standing right over.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Disappointing.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Very disappointed in all  three that I've had.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,They lose connection to the internet all the time.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Very very frustrating.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I have excellent internet reception and I even put in an extender to help out and they still lose reception all the time.,"1,4",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,My last one just straight up stopped working and the day it did was the exact day that I couldn't return it anymore.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,That sucked,"4,8",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I bought this for my kitchen because I was curious about whether Alexa is useful or not.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,What a great buy!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"My wife and I had never used Amazon music before, but now we listen to it all the time.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The voice recognition works perfectly, even my 5 year old has no problem using it.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"My wife loves how she can select music, start/stop or change volume with voice commands while she is holding our baby daughter, since she would have no free hand to do it in the phone.","2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Also, Amazon has great lullaby stations!",7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Amazon's Dot comes up short when we're talking about general facts.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Alexa doesn't search the web for relative information as compared to Siri.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I can ask the identical questions to Siri or Alexa only to have Alexa answer 'Sorry I don't know that answer' or 'Sorry I don't understand the question'.,"2,5,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,About the only thing she does well is play and control music selections.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I still have been unable to setup the Echo Dot.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The Iphone App still shows setup page not complete.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"From what I have been able to determine, the 'Home' controls, i.e.",4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,1,"Dot not very useful, will go in a drawer of unused items.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Perhaps we are asking difficult questions that Alexa cannot answer.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But we don't get much out of our questioning.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I guess it just has to be one subject and one verb in the question.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Then last night, when we were in bed at 11:30 pm, Alexa started playing music at a high volume level.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We had to turn off the microphone and unplug it.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The free ebook on the Echo Dot didn't give much explanation on how to talk to Alexa.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"But it's still a fun little item for asking the weather, though it doesn't understand the pronunciation of our city and I have to ask a couple of times.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"We were hoping to use it like the Etymological Dictionary, finding out the origins of words and things.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We'll keep trying.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It is a unique device and I'm sure it will only get getter in time.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Less then 6 months after I got it its not working right it's slow and lagging can't connect to the Internet now I can't return it,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Love this - it's got a lot to learn but it's certainly helpful around the house.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I can ask 'what's the traffic' and she'll tell me how long it's going to take to get to work (pretty close in terms of timing); 'add ____ to the shopping list' - I never forget the list on the counter since it shows up on the app; 'play _____' radio station, Pandora channel, news flash - super helpful.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The speaker is decent, not great, so I just connected it to a Bluetooth speaker and it's perfect.",1,P,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,Decided that it worked so well that it needed and stylish makeover.,"1,3",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,So I secured it on an old radio box and the wooden box make the speakers so much more vibrant and the box I have lets me have all the buttons.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Essentially this is an Alexa listening unit rather than a playback for streaming music.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Even with the ability to pair to a BT speaker, this is not a good alternative to an Echo...","1,3",P,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,A great concept but still very much a work in progress.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The main problem is that it is unreliable as it is plagued by underwhelming voice recognition.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Many times thinks that it is summoned even though there were no words remotely close to its name.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It seems to have gotten worse with time (perhaps after activations increased and the Amazon service is too slow to cope).,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Price is good and the potential is there but the G units are way more accurate.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Well, it does connect to the internet, it does respond to voice control, and it does what it says it's supposed to do.","1,2",P,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"Connectivity is decent, though sometimes playback gets cut off sometimes.",1,"P,C",,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I think that may have more to do with my home bandwidth or something rather than the device functionality.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The Echo Dot is great for smaller rooms like offices, bathrooms or bedrooms.","3,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,You still get all the functionality of Alexa without having a large echo or tap unit as an eye sore in the room.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,You do lose volume with the smaller Dot but in a smaller space it doesn't really make a difference.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,If you buy this make sure to take advantage of the Alaxa newsletter so you get all of the new (they add stuff every week) functionality and apps out of it.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Also take a look at the app wiki so you can activate all the stuff you will actually use.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,This is the second Echo Dot I've purchased after initially getting one to control my entertainment devices in my den.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I've since added some wifi outlets to control lighting and I have a wifi thermostat, so all of them can be controlled from either Alexa (upstairs or downstairs) by whichever one can hear me better.","4,6",,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"The iHome device I paired it with shuts off after a certain amount of time, so that does me no good overnight.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,(not an issue of the echo) Outside of the sound it works great.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I had to figure out why the rings were flashing overnight (it drove me nuts at first)...it means you have a notification.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,2,The speaker is terrible.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Awful.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I can pair it to bluetooth speakers, but then again, I could just pair my phone to the speakers.",1,C,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,Prime music used to be included in your membership.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I don't understand why it's not portable.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I would love to be able to move it from one room to the other to use it as a morning alarm, but it has to stay plugged in in the living room to be of any use to me at all.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It definitely does not do enough to be worth the $50 price tag, particularly when it's stationary and has poor sound quality.","1,3",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If you're just going to use the Dot for podcasts, internet radio, news briefings, weather, home controls, etc., the included speaker in this little unit is fine.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If you listen to a lot of music, the Dot is really intended to use through an external speaker or audio system, via either a male-male headphone cable (not included) or Bluetooth.","5,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,One great use for these is to turn an old clock radio that has an audio-in jack into a voice enabled internet radio and alarm.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I actually think Amazon would do well to release an Echo clock radio, but meanwhile retrofitting one with a Dot also works.",8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I converted two Logitech internet radios this way, and a standard stereo Sony clock radio.",5,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,I use them ALL THE TIME.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"When I discovered all the practical uses for the Echo, I couldn't wait to buy some Dots so I can have Alexa all over the house.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Now I don't have to get up and go to the main Echo to ask or tell Alexa something.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I use these for everything from making lists, setting alarms and timers, asking about the forecast for weather and traffic, playing music, controlling my smart home devices, and much more.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The Dot is a particularly good value for the money; the speakers are a bit tinny sounding but that is overcome if you add an external speaker for better sound quality.,"1,3",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I wholeheartedly recommend the Dot if you just want to try out all the things Alexa can do to help make your life a bit easier.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I have the full sized Echo and love it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Got one of these for the bedroom to play kids music during bath+dress time.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It mostly just wants to play games.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"The bad news is all of the audio comes out of either the Dot speaker OR the AUX out, never both.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,There's no way to have music sent through the AUX jack while Alexa responses like weather and calendar updates come out of the Dot speakers.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,This means you either have to have your stereo on all the time or plug in the Dot for music and then unplug it for general everyday use.,"1,6",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"This isn't a dealbreaker, but it's a pretty aggravating oversight.",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,"Half the time I ask Alexa to play certain music the response is ' I'm having trouble hearing you', whereupon I unplug and replug device and all of a sudden she can hear me.",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,We had not informed anybody that we had an Echo at that time.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"I use it mainly to control the lights in my house, but I know she can do so much more.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I have some problems making it interface w/my Ecobee 3, it most often says it can't perform that function even though it is connected and set up properly, but considering it works fine everywhere else, I'm okay w/that.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Small, non descript, most people don't even notice it even thought it sits right in front of my TV.",1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Very responsive, hears me 95% of the time (and sometimes picks up random things from the TV), even from the other room, and I can talk in a normal voice, not yell (XBOX you need to step up your game, you hardly ever hear me even when I scream at you!)",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Wish it was more interactive with other smart home products (like my receiver so I could change the volume on my sound system), and the shopping list worked better w/OneNote.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Still needs improvement, but I can't imagine going back to life w/out Alexa.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,When we 1st got the dot a few months ago I loved it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Now, I can't keep the dot paired with my Onkyo tx-nr626 speakers, after a few hours off, we have to manually pair them again.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,It is becoming a pain.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,We use this mainly for listening to music.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,If we could fix this we would be happy campers again.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Device I bought three months ago has given up, it's restarting itself again and again, when I do search it restarts, return policy is of very short duration.","2,3,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Not a fan.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It was sporadic at best, glitched many times, and wasn't very adaptive at realizing what I wanted to say.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Plus, there's not really much out there that I'd need this for anyways.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Sure, it's great for setting alarms and telling it to play music on your bluetooth speakers, but these are all things that can be done with your phone and this only provides a TINY convenience factor...when it works.",5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"When it doesn't work, it's frustrating to no end.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"As this product is now, I'd rather be guaranteed my actions work by using a phone and doing things 'the old way'.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Hard to set up.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I have a larger Alexa and the echo dot was for the office.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It has trouble syncing with wifi in multiple places.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I purchased it to ask it questions.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If I see some one on tv or see some reference to some place or some historical event, I like the idea of being to use it as a verbal search engine.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I don't have any interest in ordering things verbally or controlling appliances verbally.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Recently I have been seeing adds on tv for the Google Home.,"4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I looked it up and the reviews state it is much better as a verbal search engine than Echo Dot.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I will purchase one of those.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The Echo Dot doesn't seem to be able to give detailed answers on any of my questions and often says it cannot answer the question.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"According to the reviews, the Google Home is much more capable as an information search engine.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Wasn't given 2nd generation, only the black dot.","5,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Sometimes can't fill the TV request.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Fun to interact with if you ask the right questions.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It is now several days later and I just looked at Alexa and guess what?,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Her sides are white.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"I wasn't paying attention to her sides, just the top.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,We did get the 2nd generation and enjoy playing with her.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bought this to use where my full Echo was having issues connecting to speakers.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"From that perspective, it works well.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"My only complaint, and while it may be 'minor' to some, it is a major inconvenience for the application this was purchase for.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The Dot was working with the remote, but for some reason, it now no longer does.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Going through the configuration app indicates the dot and remote are connected, but it just turns on / off when trying to speak a command.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Well, I am attempting to use the echo Dot with my Harmony Elite and hub.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The integration between these apps is nowhere near functional.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The Alexa app attempts to assign features and control that does not correspond to the harmony software setup.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,In my case I have multiple equipments in multiple rooms and when Alexa attempts to assign functionality it has no relationship to what room associated with what function associated with what equipment.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I am working with Amazon Echo technical support to try and get the app a little more functional by allowing the user to turn off and remove some of these features that do not apply.,"2,4",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I think the designers are overstepping their capability here.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I will update this review after the process is complete.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Returned,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,This device is the infancy stage of a future (as pictured in many a science fiction story) of useful human / computer interaction.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"The limitations are frustrating, but it will come.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,it will come.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Amusing when a TV add says 'Alexa' (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve .",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,..  Ha ha!,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Voice recognition is very good; and I think that was the tough technological nut to crack.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"The rest (improved AI and interfaces) is easier in my opinion, and will progress rapidly.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Must connect with Bluetooth if you need to use the internal speaker as well as connected speakers.,"1,6",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,You need a smart blue tooth receiver that turns on and off with your speakers and automatically reconnects to the dot if you want to avoid always having to connect whether manually or through an Alexa command.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Other than that, brilliant.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Example: most of the time we use Alexa to turn lights on/off.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,No external speakers needed as the internal speaker is sufficient.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"But, when we want music we have to power external speakers and say, Alexa connect Bluetooth if it doesn't issue automatically with the Bluetooth receiver.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,When we're done listening we have to shut off the BT receiver or disconnect the Bluetooth.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Not yet perfect system, but pretty darn cool.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The external speaker management is my only gripe.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The sound is not at all like the Echo.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I am still on the fence if I want to return it and just buy another echo because of the sound quality.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It works for having an 'extension' for your Echo to add things to your list(s), playing your music etc.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"This sucks my phone speaker is better and it has to be plugged in into the wall to beable to to play and the whole reason I got it was because it said I was Bluetooth, I'm sending it back and getting a louder better speaker not from amazon for $20-30 dollars not $49.99 because it was a waist of my money.","3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I'm gonna send it back tonight and get my money back,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"I bought this thinking it would sound as good as the bigger one I have, I ended up returning it, the sound was awful.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Alexa is not as smart as Google Home but she is cheaper and in this size/form it is cheap and easy to use.,"2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The only positive compared to GH is the presence of the audio-Out port.,"1,5",P,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The companion android app is crap though - very slow to start and not very functional.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"And it can't be used to cast video or audio to chromecast, same way amazon video can't be cast.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Amazon is loosing out by not allowing this functionality, since not many people are buying a proprietary fire stick.","1,2",O,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Have been using it for a while now and here are my observations.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The response time for any command for Alexa is quite amazing.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I am not going to repeat all the details of how you can shut of the light , play music blah blah.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But the major drawback I notice is the lack of integration with Google (there is a way to leverage AWS to connect the Dot to google and costs about $5 or so a year based on the requests you make).,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I still have not figured out a way to stop the alarm, (cancel command clears out all the alarms for other days you set up to), and  there is no way for you to select which sound you want to play by talking to Alexa, (it has to be done through the app).",2,,Inquiry,
B01DFKC2SO,4,These are two of the many issues I felt that Amazon needs to address.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Overall a satisfied customer waiting for further improvements down the road.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The Amazon search engine is weak to say the least.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,And Alexa acknowledges commands from male voices better than female.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,We do not use it much but to ask for the current weather conditions.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,We've been using this for 2 scenarios: set-up kitchen timers and read wikipedia for you.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Both works fine, with some understanding issues for complex or long sentences.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Unfortunately it cannot search on youtube and play songs from there, that would be ideal when you have crunky kids around the house with little patience for you to pick-up the phone and do a search by typing, and, then let them hold your phone, that is a dangerous thing in its own.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I never do reviews, but this thing is so life-changing, I just had to do one just to give it 5 stars.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I can't believe I didn't get this sooner.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Would make for an excellent Xmas gift.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The microphone captures commands easily and  set-up was a breeze.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The biggest downside about the dot (and probably all echo devices) is the fact that Alexa uses Bing as its default search engine, which makes for an overabundance of 'hmm, I'm not sure' responses.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I've yet to test out connectivity to smart home devices, which I've read is one of Alexa's strengths, so my rating may change.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"But so far, the dot doesn't serve much more than as a little novelty and entertainment trinket in my home.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Have bought a couple of these!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,They work really well!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I like my full size Alexa better but these are great for bedrooms and such!,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Update one died last night!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Tried all the trouble shooting steps but it still will not find the Internet.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The other one is still working fine but for some reason this one is basically a paperweight now.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Works about as expected.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Occasionally not hearing what was said - or not hearing it properly, and this is after voice training.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"However, voice control is still in its infancy.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Still not entirely natural language, but closer than many prior voice control technologies were just a few years ago (looking at you in particular, Xbox).","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Seems to work well so far with other devices (Wemo outlets and a Harmony Elite), with minor hiccups.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Still needs integration with FireTV boxes.,"2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Google already does this with Google Voice Assistant and Chromecast, so Amazon need to catch up.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,One star off for this.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Still needs work but provides a lot of functionality, once you get past the default marketing concept that underlies the first level of things it can do.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"If you enable the skills you can unlock a lot of useful capabilities, from daily bible reading plans, to turning on appliances with added technologies, playing music from your uploaded library or playing iheart or pandora radio stations.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"There is much still to explore, but answering basic questions is pretty limited and hit or miss as well as reading articles from wikipedia.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Even with skills you have to be pretty precise how you ask for something like play iheart radio station wtvn radio instead of play iheart radio station wtvn 610 radio which never seems to work.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,or ask bible app for daily reading plan instead of play daily reading plan or ask bible app for daily plan.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,And don't believe people about the speaker capabilbiy.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It isn't high quality for playing music but it is fine for reading applications if the room isn't too large.,"1,2,6",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It might not be loud enough for a double room like a kitchen open to a living room area especially if there is a lot ambient noise.,"1,6",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,You would think by now it would be able to answer questions but it doesn't even asked a simple question as what's the number one song out right now and she couldn't even answer it she said I don't know,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"With a smart phone, an iPad, and a laptop, I found no real use for this.","3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Also, with folks talking about their microwave ovens spying on them, I was uncomfortable with always have a continious open ear in the room, often offering unwanted comments or answers to questions not asked.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Returned.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It's  ok for $50 I'm glad I DIDN'T give more than that for it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"It comes on by it's self when u least expect it to, it tells you that it don't know how to help you when you ask it to search for something and it also don't play all of a sermon when you try to listen to one from Ref Net, breaks up a lot when playing or it just stops.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Didn't like this always having to reset so we went with Echo big one and love it,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,So far just meh... Not sure if there is an issue with mine but Alexa hears me ask for things and starts to respond and then just stops and is unresponsive.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,She'll start playing music I ask for and it will play a few words and then stop.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,WiFi signal is strong... Not sure if anyone else is having this issue.,2,,Inquiry,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Not a fan of the design but for those who like Pebbles, this is right up your alley!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I really wanted to love the pebble but in the end it is only ok.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The hardware is good and it looks much better in person than in photos online.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The software is the issue since 3rd party developers are not really supporting the platform and it has second best phone integration.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,I was hoping pebble health would be able to replace my fitbit but it isn't as good and I get some very odd sleep data from it.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,If you are interested in a smartwatch this might be a decent place to start but you might be happier with something that has more functionality.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,I didn't like the format and I wasn't a fan of the app either.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,The user interface and graphics didn't sit well with me.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,Not my kind of watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I like things streamlined like Samsung and this was just a different set up and older school.,"1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,Ordered a new Pebble Time smart watch.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Received what seemed like a customer return or a refurbished unit.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Missing plastic film on screen.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Missing plastic wrap on power cable.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Screen bezel creaks badly with slightest pressure.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Debating on whether to return it due to bad creaking noise.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Soft touch band feels nice.Buttons are solid.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,1.25 inch screen acceptable though would have been better with 1.5 inch screen..,1,"P,R",,
B0106IS5XY,4,i love the watch but there are a few issues with the design.,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,1. the finish scratches really easily: any bump on a somewhat hard surface will scratch the matt finish on the watch-face.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,2. the software needs work: i am constantly having to uninstall/reinstall the pebble time app for android.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,I did find that if you disconnect then reconnect the watch it sometimes fixes the issue but i shouldn't have to do that twice or more a week.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,From time to time the battery life goes form 3-4 days to 5-6 hours; the watch won't update; i can't load setting in the android app and I won't receive notifications.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,There is a large amount of watch-faces to chose from and a lot of apps.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I'm happy about it but i wish the software was better.,"2,3",,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,3,I bought this Smartwatch for my boyfriend and he loves all of the functions.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,The only thing he wishes it has is a music application.,2,,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Why we are rating this as three stars is because the band that is provided has caused a rash, blisters and looks like a burn.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,He is now looking for a different band because he truly loves the watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I really liked this watch when I saw it on a friend.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I have worn the watch 4 months and the buttons have been difficult to operate and eventually the watch would freeze up.,"1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, even with the backlight the screen was too dark and lacked sharp color.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I have contacted Pebble customer service for a replacement watch.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"If I don't get a replacement and it is better ,  I doubt I will order another of these.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,This is my first smart watch that my mom bought for me as a celebratory gift.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,This watch has a variety of free watch faces available for download on its 'app store' which allows you to customize it.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"There's a lot of apps available, but a lot of them seem redundant, such as having a timer, stopwatch, 'flashlight', or pedometer.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,There doesn't seem to be anything 'new'.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I actually haven't tried any of the fitness apps, so I have little else to add.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's okay when it comes to maneuvering through the watch's interface.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,IIt was confusing at first because I kept trying to use my finger on the screen like a phone.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I got used to it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I'm buying different watch bands to accessorize it up!,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Very entry level smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,My 13 year old son wasn't even interested.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Worth spending a bit more for something with more features and better looking interface.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B0106IS5XY,4,The watch does not come with a heart rate monitor.,1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It's too bad Pebble went out of business.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The big attraction to me is that the Pebble will go almost a week without recharging.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I have the Samsung Gear, that although a nicer looking watch and more feature laden, has to be charged every day.",5,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,And the Samsung is not unique in that respect everyone I know who has a smart watch has the same issue - they need to be charged daily.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,This works great but the interface looks like it is from the 90's.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,Also it scratches VERY easily when knocked.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I was happy with the way it functioned but it did appear to stop synching with my phone only after a couple of weeks.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"We returned it & ordered a new model of The Pebble, Pebble steal which is much more durable & so worth the extra $$ :) Don't waste your dollah on an Apple Watch!","1,5",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Great, works as expected.",3,,,

B0106IS5XY,5,"(all apps are enabled automatically) the always on screen work well in lit areas, people complained about angles but the way you look at your watch doesn't effect how well the time reads, the only time angle effects readability is when you testing the angles, so for use, it's brilliant.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,

B0106IS5XY,5,They have other cool features but those I mentioned were the most important to me.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,A really big plus on this watch is the battery life.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,So far I got 5 days and 10 hours.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,4,You can only set up to 10 alarms.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,But I put the snooze on for 10 minutes.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,That would've worked perfectly if my son hit the zzzz instead of the X. The.other smart watches the alarms will only sound no vibrate.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's not a touch screen it works with buttons.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's a duller screen than an LCD screen.,"1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,But I suppose that's why this watch battery will.keep a charge for a longer time.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It's all right but for me it has a very steep learning curve.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It comes with scanty instructions and their 'help' page needs lots and lots of work.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Maybe I'm just too old to jump right on the system so I'll try to find a 14 year old to help me out.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Yes the company is gone, and the servers could stop working any day, but it was a really good smart watch for the price, the biggest reason being it wasn't trying to do too much and it had the right display tech for a watch.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I really don't understand why they were the only ones to use the e-ink screens.,1,O,,

B0106IS5XY,5,The fact you can get 3 or 4 days of battery life from it should have made it the standard.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I like that it wasn't trying to replace my phone, it does the activity/sleep tracking stuff that most people wanted, and displays notifications and such, and even allows simple replies.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I loved that it worked with my running app to show stats and allow me to pause my workout too.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wasn't sure I would like or use a smart watch but honestly I bought this one as a backup in case my current one dies.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,Horrible watch!,3,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,"I dont normally write reviews, mostly  because im satisfied with the product, but this review  was necessary.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Battery life is a little less than expected, and I've been doing my best about not playing incessantly on it to detract from what the average life would be.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It seems to run on average about 3-3.5 days, though what it does in that time makes it well worth it.",1,P,,

B0106IS5XY,5,I wish more smartwatch manufactures abandoned the idea of making a smartwatch that was just a smartphone with a smaller screen and weaker battery.,1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"In my opinion, a smartwatch is not a stand alone device, but an extension of your smartphone.","3,4",,,

B0106IS5XY,2,My problem was it wouldn't stay connected to my phone with Bluetooth.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It kept loosing connection.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Was okay for what it did.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Battery life left a lot to be desired.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I was able to return it without issue.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Would say get it if you dont mind charging every other day.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Does not meet the 5-7 day they advertise.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Everything was ok until this morning.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I purchased the watch over a month ago and this morning I woke up with the screen covered by condensation.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"This watch is supposed to be waterproof and I have never used it on a pool or at the sea, I just shower with it daily.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have attached an image so you can see what the problem is.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Great functionality but poor materials.,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,I've had this watch for about 6 months and it is in horrible shape.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,You shouldn't need a screen protector for a watch?,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I had the older pebble and it was built well.,"1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,This one not so much.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Not durable,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Very simple and bad conection,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Features aren't very good,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I tried charging it many ways and it never turned on.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I have to return it for a full refund, I'm very disappointed.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Money west,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,This watch works great for what I wanted it for.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I have an iPhone 6 Plus and the pebble app.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I usually charge the battery about once a week.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The watch seems to track my steps and my sleep pattern very well.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The companion app with IOS hasn't given me any trouble yet.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,Compared to other options for IOS I feel these watches would be a good purchase for basic health tracking.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,You can also get any standard 22 mm watch band for it.,"1,5",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,10/11/16 Still loving this watch there were a few updates that pebble came out with but everything running correctly I even have it controlling my media center at the house.,"3,4,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I have the original Pebble, which works great and I have been a huge advocate for it.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"However, the Pebble Time is a complete failure in my opinion.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"It is extremely difficult to get it to pair, it constantly has errors, the user interface is horrendous, the app fails constantly (iPhone version), and the watch face is really hard to see without the backlight on.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Plus the battery life is not as good as the original, lasting about 1 day instead of 3 or 4.","1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,So it basically took all the positives of the original pebble and turned them into negatives.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I love the display/faceplate choices.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It's easy to read and see.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"What I don't like is the lack of availability of support for questions and problems, the inavalability of a manual (on-line or in the box) and how often it needs to be charged.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,My original pebble held its charge for at least 4-5 days.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The new one is telling me it needs to be charged almost every day, which I find frustrating and unacceptable.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Love my watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Battery life is great.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"They only thing is that I can not start a new text, they have canned message that you can use to reply or you can use your voice.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Everytime I try to talk into it it never u derstands what I'm saying.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,I am not able to carry my cell phone on me while working so this is nice to have.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It alerts me on calls and messages.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I held back from giving my review for the watch, but I've had this watch for two months now and I've been having problems lately.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"At first it was working great, doing all of the functions I needed it to do (i.e.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"fitness tracking, notifications for calls/texts, tracking sleep), was always connected to Bluetooth like promised.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"After a while the battery started to slack, as it seems to be dying a day after charging.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Soon after, the watch would stop connecting to my iPhone and the app -- which lost some data in the moments that it stopped working.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,Now I have a hard time with the basic functions of it.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,It keeps turning off by itself at random times and just doesn't hold up to what it used to be anymore.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"After having it for such a short period of time compared to other reviews, I think this watch should have been less than $50 than the $90 I had paid for it (at the time of purchase).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Overall I did like it because it helped me in my daily life as a busy, on-the-go theater undergrad.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Unfortunately though, I will not be buying another other ever again for its short lifespan.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,So I've had this for a week and the first thing I realize is the brightness of the watch is not that good that being said the color also is not very good and the size is small a little hard to see that part is two stars maybe even one star the band has a good feeling to it and paring with a iPhone 6 Plus is good I get all my texts and messages and phone calls that I can see before I look at my phone and there is no ring tones just a vibration I give that 3 stars I'm in construction so most of the apps are stupid .so I think it's a little pricey for what you get also the charger can fall off easy.you have to have pebbles on your phone so the watch will work well know it stopped pairing with my iPhone 7 plus,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,both complains and praise
B0106IS5XY,4,While I DO love this watch there are some obvious pitfalls.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The major one of course being that the company that manufactures and supports these watches was purchased by Fitbit and was essentially shut down.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Now while fitbit has said they will 'maintain the user experience through 2017' who can even tell what that means.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,There is no real visible support for this watch if you are in fact have difficulties with the hardware or software.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Having said all of that, I do really like this watch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Its a great, inexpensive alternative to the Apple Watch and has some wonderfully convenient features.","2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love the variety of watch faces and the ability to quickly check a text message with tracking down my phone while I'm in a meeting is priceless.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only 'problem' to speak of so far is unreliable Bluetooth connection but I can usually remedy the problem by forgetting both connection and re-pairing the watch to my iPhone.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Hopefully Fitbit will find room for Pebble support within its brand, if not, I'll enjoy this watch while I can.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The Pebble Time works really great if you don't set the bar high (I was able to buy at $60 - and well worth the price).,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The first day I thought I might return it - then I realized what it needs to be optimized (at least for iPhone).,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wouldn't expect much in terms of Pebble apps - but as a notification machine (with long battery life) for your wrist - it can't be beat.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Just make sure your notifications are set to show up on lock/closed screen - and you'll be set by how much you can get out of the watch just using that alone.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,My only gripe is turn by turn directions on Google Maps (and this may not be entirely Pebble's fault) - Google doesn't seem to notify the last direction (i.e.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,- arriving at destination on right in 300 ft).,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Other than that - love it!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,The company no longer supports this product.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,You need  to download information to the watch in order to use it.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Why is this watch even being sold if the manufacturer no longer supports it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Not an applewatch but is great for the price.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Great device to test the smartwatch waters.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,BELIEVE ME!,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,it has amazing battery life and is very functional and comfortable on the hand.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,but believe me they have the worse customer support.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"it takes them forever to reply to you around weeks, and sometimes they just answer stupid not even bothering reading the whole email.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,and their prices went up.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,your better of checking the new samsung gear s 2 or LG urbane.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,what made pebble special is battery life.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,and right now other companies are stepping their game in that department.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,go for another brand.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,ps.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"owner of pebble steel and pebble time , LG urbane and Apple watch (which i gave as gifts to my family members)","4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Got this and used it for about 2 months and then it stopped receiving texts and other notifications.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,Other than that it's not bad,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"While Pebble has in fact shut down, the rapid price drop has been a welcomed addition.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"This watch is amazing, I also own the HR version.","3,5",,,

B0106IS5XY,5,"Fantastic watch, wouldn't replace it with anything else but a Pebble.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Worked only for 2.5 months then died.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,All it shows on display is an electric plug with a lightening bolt above it(the permanent pebble blue screen of death).,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,There is no support to get it replaced .,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Gives the same display after charging for several hours.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,"For what it is and what I use it for, at this price point  - it's a smart choice.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Buyers should be aware that Pebble customer and tech support is very thin.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"No phone support, only the possibility of email advice after a significant time lag.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"While I have heard that others like their Pebble Times, in my case, the new watch is not connecting to my phone's Bluetooth..While I realize that Pebble is a startup with limited resources (and am sympathetic),  the lack of tech assistance is a real problem for me.","1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Watch is great, but charging cable malfunctioned after 2 months.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Now, not charging.",1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,Only issues I have is it needs to be charged at least every 4 days definitely doesn't last 5 to 7 days.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,And it has frozen up on me once but that was a day or two after getting it and hasn't happened since.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,I am a dog groomer and constantly have the watch in the water and am pretty rough on it and it's held up well so far.,"1,4",P,,

B0106IS5XY,3,"This is a very cool watch, too bad the band broke the first time he wore it.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Had to order a new band.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Scratches very easily too.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Shipper did a wonderful job.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Loved the watch, and then I found out FitBit bought Peeble and sometime in 2017 they will not be providing any support for your Peeble watch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Therefore making it useless.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love my Pebble Time!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It does what it says it can do and I am surprised at how much I rely on it.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I even enjoy changing watch faces from time to time.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's like getting a new watch whenever I want.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only negative is this: I bought the black and every time I hit my wrist on something it scratched the 'frame'.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Yesterday I took some fine sandpaper to it and now it looks like brushed steel and shouldn't scratch anymore.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,3,I'm downgrading my original review to only 3 stars.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,My husband loved this watch but after less than 6 months of wearing on the weekends the band broke while he was traveling.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Watch fell through a grate in the jet way and was lost.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Watch is to expensive for band to fail so soon.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I loved this watch but be warned if you listen to your phone in the car over Bluetooth, having the watch connected while streaming music to a car will make the music skip and jump around.","1,2",O,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Very annoying.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,But other than that this is an amazing product.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Great interface and good features.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's too bad it can't integrate with the iPhone more.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"This is the best smart watch on the market, bar none.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Better battery life than anything else (except the pebble time steel), simple interface and I get all my notifications there so my phone can spend more time in my pocket.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I'm lowering my review from 5 stars to 3 because fitbit already made me give them an email address as part of the newest update, and randomly removed some apps from my watch.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,It's only a matter of time before they kill everything pebble related - why compete when you can crush instead?,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Nice watch for the money!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I'd love to be able to tweak it more but the basics are indeed present... Also small learning curve for do's & don'ts to minimize heavy battery drain.,"1,2",O,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,4,For example watch faces that poll for the weather temp or have continual animation will definitely drain the battery at stronger rate than a simple analog watch face with out the second-hand.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,screen not to clear,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Worked great, dead in a few months.",3,,,

B0106IS5XY,5,"I run a darkroom and need to time my film processing, this is best watch and timer i have found bar none.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I use the Multi Timer app and its been perfect for what i need.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Its also a great watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I bought this one to replace an original Time that was from the kickstarter, i got that one second hand.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The original one was a bit beat up when i got it and the vibration motor had problems so i got this replacement.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Very basic and cheaply made.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Mine fell apart within a month..,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The end pieces of the band broke off so I can no longer wear it.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Haven't even bothered to try repairing it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Your better off without this product.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Trust me.,"4,8",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Spend the money on a really nice brand/model..,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Watch isn't being supported any more by Pebble and I was disappointed with how easily the case scratches.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"These 2 watches came in worse wear than I expected, but they work.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"New bands, screen protectors and skins made them presentable enough as gifts to preteens.","1,6",O,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"However, with the demise of Pebble I wish I had made a different purchase.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Love the number of apps available for this.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"But, one bit of warning.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Although you can initiat calls from the Pebble Time, you cannot actually talk with it since it does not have a speaker (just a microphone).",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"That was disappointing to find out, but not a deal breaker.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The other issue as others have noted is the poor battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I have yet to get much more that 2 full days out of a single charge.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Otherwise, I love how the watch fits.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,wasn't for me.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,i used the original moto 360 with the touch screen.,"1,4",O,,
B0106IS5XY,3,going from that to this just didnt do it for me.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,no actual problem with use.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,just didn't like the lack of a touch screen.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Got the PT after heard aboyt Fitbit acquiring Pebble.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Decided to get it becuase I knew it's going to be usful for me anyway.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The watch is great.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Contrast is lower on this comparing to the OG (Which I have) but still good enough.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only problem I have is the fact every 3-4 weeks I get the SOS screen which says I need to restore the watch software.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Can't tell what's the reason but for now I can leave with it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Pebble is no more exists but this watch is still the best because it does what our smartwatch need to do and for 5-6 days + when you out of battery you still can see the hour for about 12 hours,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,So far has been a awesome watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Biggest thing I went for on this watch was how long the battery lasted compared to most other watches and last pretty long though like anything with a battery not sure how long in general the battery's lifespan.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Open package received.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Disappointed.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,The watch itself seems good.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,a perfect imitation apple iWatch it doesn't have all the same features but still acts the same.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,It's blutooth enabled to work well with your iphones.,"1,2",O,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,thou I don't have much faith in the wrist band.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I think it might be great but I don't know if it will last a very long time.,1,I,,
B0106IS5XY,5,More to come when I give it to my little brother as a birthday gift,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I have not been able to use this watch yet because it requires some sort of Pebble app with a Pebble account to even turn the damn thing on.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"No thanks, Pebble.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Form factor is nice, though.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Love this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Does everything I want it to.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Shows notifications and works well with my iPhone 7.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Highly recommended if you want a smart watch but do not want to spend as much as a Samsung gear or a iWatch,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Bought it for my husband.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It was one of the few watches that had even the possibility of being Blackberry compatible.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The compatibility  is glitchy even after calling support, watching videos etc.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,But he uses it for a pedometer and as a regular old watch and when it decides not to be glitchy he can get his email and monitor his phone calls.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,All in all the product is not bad.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,We imagine that it would be spot on for an android phone.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The styling is very nice and so we are hoping for some app upgrade that will get rid of the glitches.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,3,All in all for the price we are good with the purchase.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"No problem with the transaction: timely delivery, good price, but the watch itself leaves a bit to be desired.","3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I get no more than 24 hours use before the watch stops working and needs to be charged.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, the typeface is tiny, and the watch itself feels a little too small for practical use.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Not as glitzy as an Apple watch or a Moto 360, but very functional with a great battery.","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only problem is that the buttons feel kinda bad on the plastic model.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The metal version is definitely better.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"And since all interactions are done through the buttons, it would be nice to have them feel a little more clicky and less mushy.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Worked for 6 months and then died.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Pebble support takes forever to get back to you or ignores you completely.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Don't waste your money.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this watch!!!!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I sold my Fitbit and got this instead and am so glad I did!,"3,4",,,

B0106IS5XY,5,"I have had multiple smart watches (Asus, Motorola, and the original Pebble) and I truly believe this is the best smart watch for me.","3,4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I have no internist in having a speaker phone on my watch, so even though a lot of people think that is a short coming of the Pebble watches, I think it helps keep the Pebble's price down.","1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It does not have the same screen tearing problem that the original Pebble's got after a year or two.,"1,4,5",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The Pebble Time is a very reliable and sturdy watch, which is a good thing since the Pebble company does not exist anymore (bought and dismantled by Fit Bit).",1,P,,

B0106IS5XY,5,The watch feels great on the wrist and reads well.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I mainly use it for reading texts and previewing callers, but I also routinely use the voice function to reply to texts.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I also started running again, and it is great in cooperation with my iPhone running app.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Love it!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Big problem is that Pebble has no customer service to call, everything is done via email and that could take days to get a problem resolved.","3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I owned mine for 4 months and now it will not stay connected to my phone and a frozen up.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Thanx to e-paper screen battery life is good.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"But display too hard to read for me,needs better back light.",1,"C,R",,
B0106IS5XY,4,Watch strap is cheap PU and causing skin irritation.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,"if battery life is important and you don't want to be charging every day or two, this is your watch.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love my pebble.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"There is no other color smartwatch on the market that has such a long battery life, has a microphone, is completely waterproof and does all the basics(Pedometer, notifications<email, texts, apps, etc), calendar, tells time, etc.).","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,It is very light weight and super comfortable.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I would highly recommend putting a bezel sticker and screen protector on front to protect it from scratches.(i.e.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,slick wraps or gadget wraps) I prefer the buttons over a touch screen as my old moto 360 was always accidentally being activated.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you are looking for a perfect basic fitness watch that is waterproof, has a long battery life...This is it.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only complaints are that the screen isn't vivid and bright but that is what gives it such a long battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Hopefully the newer model will fix that.,1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Now I bought a used one, but this is an awesome smart watch either way.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It hooks up flawlessly with an iPhone, which is what I use, but it will also hook to an android phone just fine too.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,There is no windows phone support but that isn't that big of an issue.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"This watch receives every notification from my phone just fine and has never missed one, and the color E-Ink display is amazing.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,There is absolutely no glare to speak of in this screen and even in direct sunlight you can still see the screen just fine.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It also has a microphone for limited voice assistance and with certain cell phone carriers, you can even reply to text messages straight from the watch.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,It also has apps to control certain aspects of your phone like music.,2,,Information Giving,also compatibiltiy
B0106IS5XY,5,I would highly recommend this watch for anyone who has an iPhone or an Android phone.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I really wanted to love this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The band was comfortable and the overall weight was near perfect.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I had two major issues:  The watch would not stay connected to my iPhone 6 plus.,"2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,I would have to go into the phone and open the app over and over to keep it connected.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,The other major issue is the display size.,1,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Its too small to see most watch faces.,1,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I would buy another one if the display size was increased and the connection issues resolved.,"1,2",R,Information Giving,"Human Usability, Compatibility"
B0106IS5XY,2,Poor battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Lasted 2 days.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I contacted pebble and they basically had me run with nothing else operating which lasted another day or two.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Basically I purchased for notifications from outlook and for long battery life with the expectation I would only need to charge On weekends.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,This failed.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The analog watch face I liked with no second hand reduced battery life by a day.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"with the battery life I had and the fact I stopped using as a result, I would have been better served by an Apple Watch.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Maybe others will have better luck.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Pebble never identified the product as flawed when I reported issues and I never received support that fixed the issue.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I purchased this watch after owning a Moto 360 for 2 years.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I was disappointed when the battter in the Moto watch failed and discoverd it couldn't be replaced.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The price was right for the Pebble and it serves the purpose I want in a smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,To me it makes no sense to pay a premium price for a smartwatch when the battery can't be replaced.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"As a former owner of the original Pebble (which resulted in defective watches three times but I was still loyal since they were all replaced under warranty), I really like the functionality of the Pebble Time and the always on screen.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,I can live without all of the Android apps as this does everything I need in terms of notifications and the like with somewhat better battery life (usually 3 or 4 days max though - not the advertised length).,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,Where it falls really short is the material used for the bezel and the watch band.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I did see others comment on how easy the bezel scratches but chose to take that risk.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Believe me, it does easily scratch -- I am by no means rough with any electronic equipment I own and out of the blue noticed two scratches on the bezel.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Really disappointed as now there are mars on it that can't be removed.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Second issue is the original band included.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"While it was comfortable, after a period of time I started developing a rash where the band meets the skin.","1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,So had to purchase a leather band for it which works fine.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"So, without the bad bezel and band, this would have been 4 stars and if battery life held true to what is advertised it would be 5 stars.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Apparently discontinued item  but no matter.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I use it to track steps at gym and it works.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"++++Yeah, Pebble the company has gone bankrupt, so be aware of this before ordering.++++ However I'm a computer guy so I ordered one anyway.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I loved my Pebble Classic and was afraid these would be pulled from sale or the price would go up once they started to run out.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Plus it's already only half the original $150 price and it works great (like the original, but color).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,As of this writing (12/24/16) the app still functions so the watches work fine.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,This could possibly change sometime in the future as the app requires you to create a Pebble account before it will connect to the watch (or do anything).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"But they do have a very big user-developer following, so hopefully they will be able to keep things running and Fitbit will let them (and/or not go out of their way to shut things down).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"***** Update ***** On April 4, 2017 the Pebble app was updated to no longer require or use any cloud based services in order for the watches to function.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"They now get all info such as weather, location etc., directly from your smartphone.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,This means the watches will continue to have full functionality regardless of any online presence.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"This is the second time I've ordered a Pebble smartwatch from Amazon and it doesn't work, it just keeps bootlooping despite whatever fix I try .","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I'm really disappointed.This is a shame and I may just have to take my business somewhere else.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The face of the watch scratched.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I went swimming with it because a waterproof watch should be a sport watch.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I can no longer comfortably read the watch face because of the scratches that appeared when I came out of the river,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Not worth the wait - Soft Plastic Soft Band/Strap, attracts Dust and never looks Clean.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Apps - just ordinary.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,Battery Life -maybe about 7 day's at a pinch.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Overall - Disappointing,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,good,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Watch works fine but the charging cable has a pin that is too short and I can't charge the watch very well,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wanted a small smartwatch that wouldn't overwhelm my small wrists.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I thought this would be a good introduction into smartwatches, since it's relatively inexpensive.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's actually everything I was looking for in a watch, and I haven't felt the need to get any other smartwatch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I love the physical buttons, that allow me to dismiss notifications without having to look down.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's great for text messaging, especially since you can dictate your messages into the little microphone.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I get about 5 days of battery life out of it before charging.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's actually waterproof, so I wear it in the shower.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I've swam with it in the pool and at a lake.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,"It worked properly for maybe 2 weeks, but then it started constantly losing Bluetooth connection.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"We did multiple factory resets (as suggested online - his phone has the proper version of Android), but now it won't even connect at all.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,The seller said they won't help since it's a tech support issue.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,And Pebble doesn't really support this model anymore since it's an older one.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Don't waste your money on this.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Spend a little more and get a supported version.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is a GREAT watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Bought it because I kept missing my wife's calls and texts from the phone being in my pocket.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Haven't missed a call since I have been wearing my Pebble.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The battery life is 4-5 days.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Outstanding for a smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,My husband had to return this for one major reason - if you use reading glasses the screen is too hard to see without them.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,It was my 2nd Pebble.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,But it just died last night after only having it 3 months and of course there is no recourse now that Pebble has been bought out by FitBit.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you purchase this watch, do NOT let the battery EVER run out.","1,6",C,,

B0106IS5XY,5,I have only had it for a month and I feel as if I got my $50 use out of it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Getting a watch dedicated to a smart phone is hard nowadays because most people only have their phones for a short period of time then switch to the next best phone out there.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,Had to throw it away because Pebble was bought by FitBit and no longer offers any support.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Went out and bought an Apple watch the next day.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,What a great Bluetooth smartphone.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It syncs easily and stays connected.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I really like being able to glance at my txts and e-mails without pulling out my phone.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Attractive and lightweight.,"1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The rubber strap can make your wrist a bit sweaty if you're outside, but it's worth it.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,This watch has died after less than six months.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,It will not charge & is now a paperweight.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I got this watch originally to help me stay connected after shoulder surgery, and I count it as being one of my greatest investments since.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Being able to text without having to get uo, get all my emails and messages without having to find my phone, and even send messages for help if I couldn't reach something or needed help from a fall.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"This watch is simple, yet powerful, and such a great tool - not to mention all the neat apps and faces and designs out there, and I've even been able to design my own watch face that I can see and read without my glasses.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Unfortunately the font in the watch itself is very tough to read if one wears (or needs to be wearing) glasses.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,"They may have gone out of business and merged with the (extended dramatic eyeroll) Fitbit, this watch is still every bit as useful and connected in every way that matters.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The flood of current or previous Kickstarter backers who still answer questions and design faces and support one another is proof that this watch is now owned by the people, for the people, regardless what company bought it out from under the public's feet.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Bought this for my 14 yr old son.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"He loves it, it stays charged for several days.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,He likes the fact that you don't have to move your arm like the Apple Watch to look at the time.,"1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Looks very nice not to bulky.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"This was my first 'Smart watch' purchase, and I bought solely based on what my sister said about her pebble.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Pro: It has a very long battery life, it's water resistant to 100 meters (~333 feet) It has a nice selection of apps that can be installed to the watch itself as well as some very nice watch faces.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Con: It is not touch screen, it does not display emoji's correctly (they look more ASCI, then the modern ones), replying to text messages does not always work and when it does Google seems to get confused as to what you said (this might be Google's fault) example would be when you say the name Cassie, it interprets it as Cathy.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Also the pebble app is a real pain to setup, as it asks you 3 different times what language you want (overkill to me)",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Love this watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"It's exactly what I was looking for in a smart watch, basically a pedometer that told the time.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's also super cute and has a lottle extra than expected like being able to answer texts with voice.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Only reason it doesn't get a perfect 5 is because the firat charger it came with didn't work, but that was resolved quickly through Pebble.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The charge of the clock goes 3-4 days.,1,O,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Not seven days.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Sad situation,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Considering the price and the features (10 mts.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"water proof, apps variety, battery life), I consider the Pebble Time the better smartwatch for Android OS.","1,2,3,5",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Beware of using Android 7.0 because it messed up ALL SMARTWATHC notifications (not just Pebble).,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,With Android 6 (Marshmellow) the Pebble work just fine.,"2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The watch serves its purpose, but the interface is primative.","1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, it recommends downloading android wear app for a better experience, but the watch is incompatible with the app.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Battery lasts 2 1/2 days, so that's pretty good.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Overall...it's just an ok watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I was in the pool and later when I check my watch I saw moisture, so I put the Watch in rice for 2 days and nothing.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Its been 1 week and there still moisture.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,NOT 30meters as advertised.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Bought this product and it came broken in the package,"3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I absolutely love this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you want a smart phone on your wrist, then this probably isn't for you.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"While it is able to do a lot, it has a very simple look.","1,2",O,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,But that's not what I was looking for.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I was looking for something that is more like an actual watch, and this is the perfect combination of both.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Pros: EXTREMELY light and comfortable, looks good, simple to set up and just as simple to use, compatible with both iPhone and android, great battery life, and I love love love that it's waterproof.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,That was a huge selling point for me!,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Cons: The only cons I have is that I am unable to respond to text messages on the watch (I have an iPhone) and I do wish the screen was just a tad bit brighter.,"1,2",R,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I like that the screen is always on, but I do have to use the backlight a lot of the time, and it would be nice to avoid having to do that so much.","1,4",R,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Bottom line: if you are looking for an every day watch that can also do a lot of the same things your phone can do, then this is may very well be the watch for you.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you are looking for an exact replica of your iPhone/Android on your wrist but in a smaller version, then you might want to spend the extra couple hundred on the Apple Watch/Android Wear.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Love the Pebble but can't recommend it since they are out of business.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Way more useful than I thought it'd be.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I love the apps and silly animations (didnt think I would but it really grows on you).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Great battery life.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I can't tell you how many hours it lasts because I lose track after a few days and charge it when I think of it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Very light.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I forget its even there.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Waterproof for real!,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Ive been in the ocean in pools and the shower with no probs.,"1,4,6",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Great watch and a great deal for a hundred and something bucks!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,5 stars all day,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Couldn't go one day without it getting scratched and this was after being careful becaus of all the warnings in the reviews.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Very, very disappointed!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The screen has major scratches and smears that hinder clearly viewing the watch screen.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Watch works though, just misleading advertisement about condition by seller.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have to say this is the BEST smart watch I have ever had!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"You can text, track steps, check emails and a lot of other things.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The price is great, and in my opinion under priced.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I have had a fitbit, that died after 2 years, and I paid $150.00.","4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is way better than that watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I highly recommend this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,A great watch overall.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"That being said, I prefer the original.",5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The overall software seems much better but the screen is so much harder to read than the original.,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,You have to use the back light or have super bright sunlight in order to see this.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The original was easily viwed regardless as long as it was not pitch black,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,If you can't read it...... My eyes aren't that bad but I found it very difficult to read notifications on this device.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,I set to the largest font and brightest setting yet notifications are still too difficult to read.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,It is easier to get my phone out.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Everything else is fine.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Check this out in person before purchasing.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Someone needs to tell the young whipper snapper Pebble nerds that just because they can read things doesn't mean everybody can.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I should not need to carry my reading glasses around with me all the time simply because I want to be able to read the display.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I don't need glasses to see my phone, so I shouldn't need them to see my smartwatch either.","3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The concept is great.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I love the convenience of not having to pull out my phone when I'm in the classroom, at church, or at a meeting.","3,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"But if I see I have a notification, yet still need to take out my phone in order to be able to read it, that kind of defeats the purpose.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"In my younger days, I would have probably given this watch 5 stars.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"For only 99 bucks, It does everything that a smartwatch should do, and does it flawlessly.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"But for someone who is over 40, I guess we have to pay more for a display that we can actually see.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Now that Pebble has been bought out by FitBit, my watch barely works.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,It does not allow for watchfaces to be changed (including the ones I paid for).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,This was one of the selling points of this watch for me and now I can't do it.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have tried doing a factory reset and it still does not work.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I'm very disappointed.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I love the looks of the watch and the features.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Unfortunately, as soon as the Pebble links to my Nexus 5 phone it immediately then drops the connection (phone sees it as paired but unconnected device).",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,The directions recommend go into the phone menu and forget the Pebble and then go into the Pebble menu and forget all paired devices and try again.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"This is when I find that the right middle button is not pulling up the menu as is indicated in the troubleshooting menu, and this is when I find out that the only customer support is by email (no phone, chat, or text).",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I sent the support request email to customer support and got the response 'We are currently experiencing a higher-than-average amount of emails but we will respond to you as quickly as possible'.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Four days later and still no response--customer support is really lacking.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I like the looks and features enough to wait another week for support and I hope they can resolve the issue.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,1,As it is I give it a 1 because it is torture to see and pay for a beautiful watch and not be able to use it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I really enjoy this watch so far.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Only have had it for about 2 weeks and it's really nice and easy to use.,"2,3,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only complaint is that I've already scratched the watchface to hell.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I read that the gorilla glass was harder to scratch but clearly this is not true.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Also I've scratched the outside metal area as well.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"All cosmetic, but I would absolutely recommend buying a watchface scratch proof cover.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"After owning Sony consoles since the PS1 was launched over 20 years ago, the fact that PS4 gutted the ability for my $300 Harmony remote to turn it on for movie watching (and redid the control scheme to make even this simple task utterly unintuitive)--now that my Sony brand controllers have started lagging to render games nearly unplayable, I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that non-PC gaming is becoming worthless.Good job Sony, you managed to murder a cash cow.","1,2,4,5,6",C,Problem Discovery,

B01LRLJV28,3,"i got the original day 1 ps4 console cuh-1000, so im comparing the new slim to this one.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"pros: its a ps4 in a beautiful and smaller console, much better controller that you can set to usb instead of bluetooth, improved wifi compared to day 1 ps4, 65w consumption playing destiny on digital form versus 108w from the original ps4, it weight a lot of less than the original, hdmi included, usb to connect the controller included.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"cons: still a lot of noise from the fan and it doesn't have a optical sound port (so i could not connect my soundbar via this port), problems with very old hdmi TVs (the original connect just fine), headset looks like it will break soon but 3 stars because it doesn't have a optical port if you don't care about that then this is the best deal on the block.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Good,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I like the system overall, but like many here, a few months in and after taking good care, the controller just completely stopped working one night.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,It was bizarre and irritating.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Also the system gets a bit too hot sometimes.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,I received a broken console,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Arrived with a broken hard drive.,"1,7",C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Nothing else wrong with the console, but still very disappointing.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Overall my experience was spoiled.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The console never powered up after I tried to install 4.5 upgrade.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,Non existent support/customer service to help troubleshoot.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,I was considering Playstation Vue as my cable provider.,5,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,But just can't trust the hardware to stay alive.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Already missed my return window with Amazon, will probably end up selling to Gamestop for a loss.","7,8",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The graphics are phenomenal.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The whole system is really great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,But I have a HUGE problem.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,We have 2 wireless headsets that will not work with this because there is no optical port on the this.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"It is on the PS4 & PS3, but Sony apparently didn't think about it when they made the Slim.","1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"So, now I have to either purchase 2 more headsets that do not require the optical cord (at least $200) or buy a converter box ($25-$50).","1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Had I known that, I would've purchased the older PS4.","4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Thanks Sony for making spend more unnecessary money.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,This is 'the other woman'.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I spend as much time with this as I do with my wife.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,played for 5 days and it has corrupted data file,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,It's only been 6 months and the Playstation had already started to turn off randomly.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,It was fun while it lasted.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Just as expected and super fast shipping!,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Great value as a package set.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Uncharted 4 is an excellent conclusion to the Drake series.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Great so far.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"I was concerned about excessive heat build up and poor ventilation, but so far so good.",1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Others have complained about it being noisy, but I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary.",1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I'd buy it again.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Time will tell if it holds up.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"I was impressed that it included everything to get started right away, including power cord, HDMI cable, and even an earbud with microphone.","1,3",O,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Serious gamers would certainly want to replace the earbud with a real headset, but it was a nice 'get you by' feature that I didn't expect.","1,5",O,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"If you get it on sale, it's a great value.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,for the price and games it was an awesome buy,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,We are a playstation family and are enjoying our  new purchase.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,I only minus 1 star because  I hate that  Playstation  doesnt do backward compatibility.,2,,Problem Discovery,(example of compalints)
B01LRLJV28,4,I have tons of ps3 games that are now coasters because our ps3 stopped working.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,4,I like the new slim design and it doesnt seem to run as hot as  my previous  system.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"This bundle came with uncharted 4 game, which  was great.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,We already completed  the game and it was very fun.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It also came with 1 wireless remote.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,These new remotes  are great and fit my hands a vit better than the previous  version.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The fact that they removed the optical audio output from this device is confounding.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,It's included on the basic PS4 and the Pro version.,"3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Without the audio output it's virtually impossible to connect to a PC speaker system (tried a number of work arounds involving DACS, etc.).","1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The Slim is clearly intended ONLY for TV use.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"If you want the higher resolution that a  PC monitor can provide, you're out of luck.","1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I probably got the only defective console ...I keep getting a different error message every time I try to play uncharted 4.....even got another disc from someone who bought the same game , same set of error messages comes up, and my game works great in theirs,..downloaded games works fine ,no complaint there,have to borrow another game to see if its only uncharted 4 that has the problem...and since I live in Trinidad and Tobago sending it back is not an option and it will cost an arm and a leg to ship it back....","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,3,Was a bit a frustrated as I ordered this as a gift for my Husband and Son and didn't realise firstly there are regional restrictions and secondly there is a monthly membership needed to get extra content etc.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I was sent a code to enter for a free year PS4 membership but the system won't accept the code and finding someway to email someone for help proved very difficult.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Also when it arrived it came with a USA plug, the fact that is was being shipped to an Irish address didn't give a hint to the seller that a USA plug would not work :( - I feel sorry for any parent that ordered this as a Christmas gift, only to find this one on the day.","1,4",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Luckily we happened to have an adapter that we were able to take off something else and put on this otherwise they would have been really upset.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I think this should have been clearly stated or an adapter included in packages shipped overseas It is all set up now and working fine but looking back now I wish I had just bought this from a local store,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,My sons hasn't stopped playing for days.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Shipped quick.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Packaged great.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Works perfect.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Slower than expected.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Main menu is frequently laggy, games take a while to load - unexpected problems on a brand new system.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,3,Most games don't even run in true 1080p.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Given that it's 2017 and the system is advertised as a 1080p system (while the Pro is 4k) I would expect games to run at a solid 60fps on 1080p, but the reality is 960p and <60fps for most games unfortunately.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Â This product stuck in loop after updating to 4.50.Need help!,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,5,It's a PS4!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Packaging came perfect.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Set up of the PS4 was very easy.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,I'm absolutely hooked on the Uncharted 4 game.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,It's an awesome game.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Literally ate a disc and damaged it within days.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,My years and years old never cleaned ps3 has never done that before.,"3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Very upset.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Online it says I have to take the panel off and remove the HDD and take the disc out myself which would void any warranty.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,And I cant play any other discs.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Don't buy the slim I guess, look up if the other has the same problem.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Got the system and in one week it started giving trouble.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Has not been reading the disc since and playstation support has been unhelpful thus far,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Its a Slim PS$ Need i say more?,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Well, this is a farcry from the PS 2 my son gave me a few years back...it streams hulu, netflix and other media perfectly.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Bluray is a plus.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I am enjoying a couple of games very much and using the controller is intuitive Uncharted 4 is a blast to play also!,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,1,Bought this in mid July of 2017 and it has already stopped working with a lot of error messages on the screen.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,I gave it to my grandson for his birthday and just found out that it hasn't been working.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Now the window to return or get support for this product is gone and I'm stuck with a very expensive PlayStation that doesn't work after two months of use.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Needless to say, I am not a happy customer.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Pros: It's great fun!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Cons: Device lacks the ability to thermoregulate.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Pros: Play during the winter to keep your room exceptionally hot!,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,It's in great condition--couldn't even tell it wasn't new--and works perfectly.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"The kids are thrilled, especially since it came with a game.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Very happy with this purchase, especially since the price was significantly less than buying a new one.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Arrived in a timely fashion.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Everything was as it should be,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I feel like this version will be left in the dust as far as developers stepping up their games for the PRO.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Stopped working after a month of use.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Enjoying it but the included controller randomly disconnects...,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,description said Used-Very Good for PlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Console - Uncharted 4 Bundle but really... horrible packaging & horrible experience all around SHOCKING!,"4,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,of course i returned.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Kids love it,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The ps4 did work for a month then it just stopped turning on...,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Works great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Plays well.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Sony has the early run bugs worked out obviously.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Just in time to retire it for a new console I'm sure......,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Bought as a gift for my son and he's very happy with it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,He bounces back and forth between this and his Xbox.,"4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"So with that, I'll just say that Sony has once again, exceeded my expectations.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Got this for my son and he's been very pleased with it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,He is find that it is very enjoyable.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Good price, recommended 100%",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,From week 2-3 the console would occasionally randomly lock up for several seconds when a game was running and shut off.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,"A week later the PS4 would never awaken from rest mode, leaving only a flashing blue light on the button.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,I would always have to plug out the console and restart to use the machine.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,"I tried different tips and solutions to these issues but none worked, so this is probably faulty hardware.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,These issues occurred almost daily.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Item came in the time given, packaging was decent.",7,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Item was as descripted and works perfectly.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,My playstation 4 dont wanna play any games,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It is what its cracked up to be!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I really don't see the main difference between this and the PS 3,"3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The PS4 came in good condition but the uncharted 4 game does not work.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It freezes every time I try to play it,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"The product is fine, the seller excellent, the only problem are the restrictions to my country (Guatemala), it's like I payed with dust or beans, why we do not have youtube app and otters, we pay you sony with money for that reason we deserve the same benefits of all.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Produced stated that it was to come with Uncharted 4 and it didn't.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,There wasn't a single game within the package.,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Would like some resolution tof this immediately,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I purchased the PS4 Slim for one game... MLB: The Show.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The console disappoints.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's design put style over practicality.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The plastic feels cheap.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The venting for air flow is inadequate.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's noisy.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Of all the PlayStations over the years, I'm surprised the latest one is my least favorite.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,For the price and what I received was pleased.My nine year old son was very happy and he purchased his extra contoller and five games with his Christmas money and Game Stop gift cards.,"3,4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Worked for a month and now it won't accept any discs.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Idk how the hell to send it in for repair.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Seems faulty, stops working and needs reset after just 30 mins of play.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,Charger cords broke with in 2 weeks,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I upgrade the drive to a 2TB unit.,"1,4",O,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Went very smooth.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Love the games and apps on this.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,Great graphics and lots of popular PS4-only games out there.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Hubby loves it, the game and the machine.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Great deal.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,He has wanted one for years now.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I hope it lasts as long as our PS3!,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,My son loves it1,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I didn't know what I was buying.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,My son wanted this for Christmas and Cyber Monday was my saviour!!!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Got it on time as described but the look on my son's face when he opened the box and realized that it was the slim version was priceless!!!!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I have a VERY happy kid!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Got here in 3 days, box a some dings on it as pictured, but everything inside was in perfect shape.","4,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Hooked up and working great so far.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Would be 5 stars if it would have been here sooner.,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Still a great deal,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"I rarely ever buy used products, let alone used entertainment consoles, so when this arrived at my home, I was suprised and extremely elated.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"My ps4 came with everything it was supposed to come with, along with the fact that my ps4 is like new.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Being completely honest— the only 'used' feature I found, was that Black Ops 3 was already downloaded on the game.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Other than at the thing was completely new.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It's a great console for a great price you will really get the deal out of this one!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Recommend it!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I can't believe that you can't play any ps 1 or 2 games,and not even PS3 games.You can't copy music videos pictures from a usb to the hard drive unbelievable!You can't even play the games you purchased on the PlayStation 3 store what the hell?","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"PS3 when it first came out it played everything from its previous consoles and it had 4 USB slots 3 card readers, this is a joke!","1,3,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Uncharted game doesnt work but fast shipping an new as described,"2,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,The HDMI did not work.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Only audio was playing when I connected it to my monitor.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Later tried with a different HDMI cable and that worked perfectly.,"1,4",P,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This is something that is not expected out of a SONY product.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"The system was said to be new, however when I turned it on there was already a user account there.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,That is false advertisement.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"The system must be used, therefore I should be entitled to at least a partial refund.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"The device is fine, however, the PSN is getting crap day by day; No new games, no backward compatible; expensive subscriptions and crap deals, glitchy transaction system.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,The case construction seems ok but the cable quality provided with this is cheap like chinese ones on ebay.,1,"P,C",,
B01LRLJV28,2,Controller does not hold charge for long.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The interface is so lame that I call it just an update of PS3 not an upgrade.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I own XboX as well and this cheap thing is nowhere near to XboX construction, service, items, interface quality.","1,2,3,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I really loved the killzone and uncharted series and wanted to play the latest ones, no new killzone is coming up and uncharted has become lame as drake has been retired completely; I find no reason to keep this wasting my space.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I do not recommend this junk from japan (unless you're an indie lover),3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"It's ok... between Playstations plus and Microsofts Xbox Live: Xbox wins hands down with more content, easier access to content and overall value.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Not impressed with PS4...,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I will be going back to my Xbox One now (4 free games a month with their service).,"4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"My system has a black screen problem, the visual and audio will randomly go out completely (most when i just turn it on after not using it for a day or two).",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"It happened a lot when i just got the system, not so much these days.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I still haven't found the reason for this, however i usually plug out the HDMI and plug it in again.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,USB port is faulty,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The order came a late.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,But the PS4 is working as expected.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Got it for $220 With uncharted4.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Never owned a playstation but it's working great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Hell of a deal,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Just like description.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Nothing wrong during shipping.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Came on time.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Very nice console,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Stopped working after only 3.5 months.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Originally, as a gamer i don't like going out of my 'comfort zone' when it comes to buying new games, but i must say, i got so addicted to uncharted that i ended up buying the first 3 uncharted's, the playstation itself, ofcourse, works as intended, i still have it to this day and use it daily","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate the business policies behind consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate the monetization of consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate console exclusives.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,BUT there are some PlayStation ONLY games this gen that I'm not passing on just because I think this is a $250 crappy media machine with games that are more expensive than their counterparts on PC and a monthly subscription required to be able to do 1/2 of the things.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,This is the most affordable way to reliably get into the playstation ecosystem.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I did not like it much because I thought that the console brought with the game of Uncharted 4, can explain to me what happened, if it really came with the game or not, I would like to be told to leave the doubt.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This really deserves a half of a star.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I paid for a console and game bundle, and only recieved the console.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,There was no game physically present.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I expected a little bit of a roughed up console (superficial scratches in the console) or a very poor box.,"4,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Instead, i just get a console with a game downloaded on there that requires a physical disc to be in the console in ordered to be played.","4,6",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I did get a refund after going through customer service of a decent chunk of my purchase; more than enough to go out to a gamestop and buy the game.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,That alone is worth another star.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,What really bugs me is the seal of approval by amazon on the box stating that everything in this box is good to go and be sold.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I hope that amazon reps read this review and take it for what its worth.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I am a forst time user of this service, and now i am disinclined to use it again.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Bought the same product twice and both times was defective.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This is supposed to play DVD's as well as Blue Ray disk.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The blue ray disk get stuck every time you try to play one.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I bought this item because I wanted to use all the features but was unable to do so.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,So I guess they can keep it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I been using PS console since 1996, i got them all, and i know this is an electronic product and it going to fail at some point.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,my PS3 last for like 6 years with no problem and the same with the other console.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I bought this as a gift from me to myself but it fail seven months later.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I use it regularly but dont abuse it.Actually i bought the cooler base.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Im not a hardcore gamer, I play for like 2 hours before work, and watch Netflix and other TV apps for like 2 hours at night before sleep.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,So dont know whats gone wrong.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Well, only 3 stars because its the first time a have problem with one of the PS console, my first slim one.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I do kinda regret getting a PS4 as the exclusives are nothing special at this moment but I am interested in Yakuza 0, FF7 remake, and several other titles.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Everything else, I play on PC.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The console will get hot so I strongly recommend getting a base that has fans to help cool it off and help preserve the lifespan of the HDD as well as internal components.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It took a while to ship it but it arrived no problem.,7,,,

B01LRLJV28,2,The review hasn't anything bad to do with Amazon.. but if you have been with Xbox that's where I'd stay..,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The games do have some good graphics but unlike the Playstation 3 u need a card just like the Xbox and Xbox 360 and 1.. more games for Xbox better made and overall not worth the money.,"1,5",P,,

B01LRLJV28,2,This item would have been perfect but it almost ruined Christmas Day for my son and because this was the only gift he was asking for and when we open it the item was missing the AC power cord so he could not play it on Christmas without the cord.,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Luckily after calling around on Christmas Day because everything was closed and I couldn't go buy one I found a friend who had one on his old PlayStation that we can use until the stores open up for us to go buy one.,4,,,

B01LRLJV28,3,"The Slim is my kids system and they asked me if it was OK/broke because of the noise, my answer is I don't know if it is normal or a bad unit.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I see lots of debates on it being the fans running when hot but that is not it, at least in my case, it's the BlueRay drive spinning at max speed which is noisy itself but it also vibrates the whole console causing even more noise.","1,4",C,,

B01LRLJV28,1,And the logo on the ps4 looks like it was heavily rubbed?,1,C,,

B01LRLJV28,2,"I'm sure experienced console gamers out there know to look out for this sort of thing, but for a guy that has spent 20+ years gaming on PCs, it was not even on my radar that you could buy a game and have it *completely* unplayable unless you shell out $5-$10/month to Sony for the rest of the life of the console.",4,,,

B01LRLJV28,2,This is about making it very clear to people (especially new ones who I think have a reasonable expectation of being able to play a purchased game without a recurring subscription) that Sony chooses to force customers to pay above and beyond BEFORE somebody has a game purchased and is flat out of luck.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"Whether it's their awesome videos or the graphics and frame rates that they can pack into such a small camera, it's always awesome!",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I honestly would recommend this camera over the Black Edition because of the rear LCD screen.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You are able to frame your shots very easily as well as adjust your camera's settings all from the touch LCD screen.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Then when you start filming you have the option to turn off the screen to save battery.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Another thing I would buy is a Wasabi double battery pack and charger.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,this camera is great but filming at high definitions takes a lot of battery power.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Having the extra batteries is almost a must!,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"The only reason I would but the Black Edition is if you really were just going for the improved frame rates at higher definitions, otherwise, this will be more user friendly and give you awesome video as well!",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have Owens a GoPro hero 3 white and now I just purchased this hero 4 this product I awesome you can do so much more and the pic and video are so.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Much better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Yes it is price but so worth it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So much more you can do,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Card Error!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Yes, am one of those persons who keep getting the infamous card error that leads to the camera seizing up!","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"And yes, I have tried different SD cards, all of which were the recommended class.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"In fact, I emailed gopro directly and gave them the specific name of the cards I was using and they replied that those cards should work!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Am still trying to figure out though why only Gopro cameras are plagued with this problem (other cameras may have this issue occasionally but Gopro has seemed to corner the market on 'Card Error').,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Of course what this means is that the sport cam that you bought to capture moments that may be impossible or very hard to get in the future (scuba diving, aerial shots, rock climbing etc.)","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,will have you pissed when you're looking back at your footage and realizing that you got 18 minutes of your hour long adventure.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Moreover, none of the features in the cam (FOV, FPS, Protune etc.)",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,will matter because Card Error will result in you not getting the footage in the first place!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It was difficult to transfer memory.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,And batteries only last an hour - so make sure you have a few,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is a great action camera and can be used in very tight places.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,My favorite part about this camera is the touch screen display.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This feature makes all the settings much more accessible and easier to use.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only problem is the camera will get very hot with extended use.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,There have been reports of this ruining the camera but my camera has lasted so far (6 months),1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I just received my Hero 4 Silver.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have to give gopro a lot of credit for improving the menu on the Hero 4 silver.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I also have a Hero 3 Black, but have always found the menu selections confusing.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Hero 4 Silver has really fixed that problem.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I debated up upgrading, but am really glad I did.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It is worth your time and money to make the upgrade.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Delivery in time, no problem.","3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,But the cam after 1month doesn't work anymore.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Screen was pink, blue, green and now the cam stay locked and no function are avalaible.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Pretty worried with that product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is horrible.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The video quality is better than the 3+ Black.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Unlike the older optional viewer, I can actually see this in full sun but using it drastically reduces battery life.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I haven't had any problems with the unit freezing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The 3 had the same problem after charging via USB/PC so I always use a charger.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3.0,"Of the 3 Black, 3+Black and the 4 Silver, overall I prefer the 3+Black.","4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The battery life is the deal breaker.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,NO complaints.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,this GoPro is amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Used it tons of times and the video is awesome!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"This version is great because of the screen on the back where you can actually see what you are shooting, but when its on the mount on a helmet or whatever, you cant see it anyway.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So much fun!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Even a mundane walk around the neighborhood was fabulous to watch when we got home.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Super easy to use.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Configure it to share your videos, or just save them to your computer.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Whatever you decide - Its just fun!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Had to RMA after 2 months :( Spent a month going back and forth with their support team and got approved for a return so they could fix/replace my new Go Pro.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Turns out the USB port is just SUPER touchy.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I have tried different computers and different cables and if I even bump the GoPro my video transfer will crash.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,POST replacement as well.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Have had this issue since day one; right out of the box.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought this unit in Dec of 2014, and I probably used it maybe 4 times, nothing strenuous: snowmobiling,Ski trip once and now the wifi on this unit won't turn on no matter what I try.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I must give kudos to customer support who really tried to help me out, but without wifi its really inconvenient to use this device.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Did a quick google search and seems like there are many folks like me having the same issue.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The deal breaker with the HERO4 is no image stabilization.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Video jiggles around so much it detracts from the content is so so annoying.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It's going back tomorrow.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,What a shame.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Disappointed that it wouldn't charge but great return policy and ordered the black instead.,"1,7",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"It works fine, except for the fact that it didn't come with a charger, the lens were VERY scratched, the cover for over the plugs, where I would put the charger, is missing.","1,7",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The silver cover is all scratched up and is broken at the top and it stabs me.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I would recommend this product if someone has the time to replace practically everything and will but a battery pack separate.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I would recommend this product for anyone who is willing to pay more to get the GoPro quality that everyone wants.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Good camera; I upgraded from the Hero 2.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"PROS: touch screen on back; you can see what you are shooting, and playback Lots of other functions I'm still learning.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Good battery life Much smaller Other mounts still work connects to my iphone via wifi (not bluetooth) via its own wifi connection (its weird; acts like bluetooth, but its wifi but doesn't need external wifi) CONS My iphone 6 doesn't connect with this.","1,2,6",P,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"On the boards, it won't.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I can turn the camera on and off via my iphone, but I can't see what is being shot from my iPhone 6 (older phones you can) mini SD card (Not really a con, but its my only device that takes this small size; can't swap around) Will be a PRO in the future, but now  a CON -- too many different settings that I selected a 'wrong' setting out of ignorance.","1,2,4,6",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'll learn,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera arrived with no battery.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I will have to buy another and charge it rapidly as I need to use it for an event this evening.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Sad oversight for a refurbished camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm glad I removed my previous review especially pertaining to the software for mac.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Used this for two week SW National Park and Old West road trip.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Captured dozens of hours of POV/Dash cam in some of the most beautiful scenery this country has to offer, and aside from notable vibration, the images are spectacular.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The vibration is the only reason I didn't give this five stars.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,GoPro needs to build in heavy duty image stabilization for a piece of equipment like this at the cost we pay.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Other than that, the only other issue I had was overheating in the desert-traveling SUV with full A/C on, and battery life could be extended.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I love how they auto-shut off the viewer display while the cam is running, but it should probably have some sort of indicator on the back side that shows the camera is operating.","1,2",R,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"This product did NOT come with the three-way pivot arm, as stated.",7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Very disappointed as that was for an upcoming trip.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Returned, images were unacceptable.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The camera will not communicate with any of my computers.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Contacted support and they said to update the firmware.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Did it.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,No change.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have some very inexpensive electronics that will be recognized by the computer every time.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This is simply unacceptable.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Cannot recommend this unit.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"The GoPro HERO4 Silver offers simplicity of use, a nice LCD display, and great image quality.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"But after six months, ours has developed a habit of turning off by itself.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,camera freezing up,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I bought my GoPro and it came in Tuesday.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Long story short, it literally had every single problem that you could find on the reviews here.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera overheated -Helicopter noise after recording with the wifi on and then downloading onto my phone -I spent two hours messing with my camera and trying to connect it to wifi.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,In roughly a two hour time span I got it to connect to my phone and able to record using my phone but after having he preview on my phone for 15 seconds it'd freeze and the GoPro itself would freeze up.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I am getting a return and hopefully the new one works how it's supposed to.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,worked for one month.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,then.....will not turn on.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,nice paperweight.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Love this !,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he is an ironworker.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Wow what great video.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,totally awesome and you can wear it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I totally recommend it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I like this one better then the black one because it has better functions and he isnt using it for certin things that the black one was for.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Plus in certain weather conditions this one works way better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,If you work in construction or outside where the weather chnages I would get this one.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The GoPro Hero 4 Silver is a great sports/action camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It works best for up-close action and takes sharp video when you can keep it framed steadily on something.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's pretty pricey and on top of the camera price you still need to buy accessories if you want to get decent video out of it.,"1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"And with such high quality recording options, if you want to do any editing, you'll need a decent computer.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The camera is great for catching high paced action, especially up close.","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Just don't expect the best landscape or far away shots.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Decided to splurge for my 5 year belated honeymoon to the Brittish Virgin Islands and get the toy that I have always wanted.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I got it it was amazing, I immediately took it out and filmed my dog, took stills, everything worked great, until it started freezing, so I had to power cycle it a few times, no biggie.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I got home I researched the freezing, and even though the SD card i bought along with the camera was recommended I decided to go for the top of the line just to make sure that nothing would go wrong on the trip.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Boy was I wrong, every other time I would try to take a picture it would freeze and I'd have to power cycle it.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Every other time in video mode it would start recording, but only record for 7 seconds and then freeze, completely fooling me and the past 10 -20 minutes of footage that I thought I was filming.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When the camera did work it was great, but at the end of our 7 day vacation, it just sat in my backpack waiting to be shipped back.",1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought the camera 2 days before I left for vacation, so I wasn't able to really see how terrible this camera was going to be.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought 2 of the recommended SD card, ensured everything was up to date software and firmware wise.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I thought this was going to be the perfect beach vacation companion and turned out to be a great paper weight.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"This is quite a common problem with this device, my advice, STAY AWAY.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The 1080/60fps setting on this camera really ends up looking great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The baked in time lapse video settings are amazing, as well as all the variations of timed video/pictures.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The biggest issue I have is the performance in low lighting situations.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The automatic ISO settings end up creating grainy pictures/videos with what I would consider fair lighting.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The night shot mode with increased exposure times, while functional, is also somewhat lacking due to the poor low light performance.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I've tried adjusting various settings in ProTune, but I still haven't been able to really get a good result.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Overall, still a great camera for active lifestyles and easy videos.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Eh,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Only beaten by the Hero 5, on order, the Hero 4 has operated perfectly and without a hitch from day one.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,GoPro should not have killed the use of my beloved wasabi batteries -1 star.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The product description said it includes battery charger and 16gb memory card.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,But I did not find it in the shipment.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I am not sure if it should be a separate package inside the same shipment or if it should be part of GoPro item itself.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Not really a fan of GoPro......bought this one year ago and its overpriced!,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"images from pictures are less than stellar, battery life sucks (on/off just for pictures - won't last a day)(video recording - 2 hours max), and editing images are a pain.....just downloading them from the GoPro is a hassle.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"1080i videos are great, if mounted to car or videoing distant objects.....underwater the images are okay.","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,IMO there are better cameras on the market.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The GoPro Hero5 is probably the same.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Well made with good quality video.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Pricier than others, but I felt confident with the name-brand market leader, since I have friends who own it and are pleased.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It lived up to my expectations, with the exception that some of the options for settings are not clear by their on-screen labels.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is circumvented by a visit to the manufacturer's website.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,love the handfree option so I can take camera shots.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,the drawback is NO zoom,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Gave as a gift.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They seem to like it a lot.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was disappointed in what the GoPro can actually do.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I think it is a super overrated camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Needed to have the absolute best light to take in any color!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Was ok for timelapse of the moon.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This GoPro is awesome.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I took it to Hawaii, got it wet, dropped it, and the quality of the picture was/is fantastic.","1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only issue is the battery life.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It dies quickly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Sure you can carry another battery, but then you yet something else you have to carry and worry about.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I bought this gopro camera to use for an upcoming vacation.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I decided to try it out at our daughters winter guard performance.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"When we got home and hooked it to the HDMI cable that is attached to our LG smart tv to watch it, the video froze after about one minute of the four minute performance.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We called go pro tech support and they informed me that their engineer's were aware of the problem and said they 'might' get the problem resolved in the future.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We were told we would have to record the videos in a lower resolution in order to play it back on our tv.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It is unfortunate to spend this much money on a video camera that will not perform as advertised and have to settle for a less quality video output.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We are not very pleased with what we have found out and just feel it is something that others who are looking at this product need to be made aware of before making their purchase.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've never owned a go pro but purchased one to record some sport related activities.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Recording some volleyball and paintball matches provided fun video and I enjoyed using it.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've given it 4 stars only because the Go Pro's lack of ability to zoom and constant fish eye lense limit it's usefulness outside of action related pov shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Just 3 stars because they come w/a diferent micro usb charger,but any ways it's amazing camera!",1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,3,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I bought this to replace my sealife underwater camera, which I could never get good photos with while SCUBA diving.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,So far am really happy.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I also bought the battery backpack, deep water housing, red filter, underwater stick, and Knog kudos video light.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The camera is great, easy to work, download video, extract stills.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Pretty much everything I wanted.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Not thrilled with the fit of my red filter as it goes over the display a bit, which leaves me a bit blind.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But the quality of film is excellent---can watch it on a big screen TV and it looks great!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Freezes all the time.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,And Sometimes takes lije all-violet pictures ....,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Disappointing,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The screen is nice for framing shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Great image quality and totally water tight (taken it down to 35m so far).,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Big issue: Generally crappy/laggy interface, which I hoped they would have fixed.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"No remote control, unlike the GoPro 3 Silver.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The app connectivity really stinks.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to get the camera reconnected.,"1,2",C,Inquiry,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Eventually reset the camera, which didn't work because I couldn't reset the app.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Then I lost my phone - hardly the solution to that problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Easily gets to 4-5 stars if they include the remote and fix the app.,"1,2",C,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Great camera but after looking to unboxing videos I realized it came out without the 2 extra set of attachments for the case, meaning the one that allows you to have a open screen and the one you could use the touch screen underwater.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I been buying products from amazon for quite a few years so is a bit of a let down.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I would have given this camera a 5 star rating is the use of the camera was a little more intuitive.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It is a quality product, just difficult to learn to use.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I have 3 professional model dslr cameras and they are easier to use when compared to the Go Pro.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The connection between the GoPro camera and the phone app works perfectly ......,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I am happy with the GoPro Hero 4, just a little frustrated by the screens for setup and changing modes.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They are very hard to see in my opinion.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Lots of options but I wish the camera zoomed in.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,We used the camera on working dogs to get a good view of the cattle in working situations but of course the video was too bouncy so my husband wore it and the video was always too far away to really get a good shot of anything.,"1,4,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Quality of the video is good though.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The battery last for only an hour..,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I basically need so many batteries!!,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"After I used the camera for an hour, it just crashes then becomes okay again... And this thing is not cheap you know!",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I've had this item for about a month now..,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I only use it for a handheld gimbal, and the LCD screen has already gone bad.. 5 days outside of the return policy.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Ive never dropped it or carelessly handled it.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Disappointed.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Worked bellow expectations for one year with consistent overheating in the most average of weather.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Continual issues with turning on and off and locking up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I used it as a dash cam, the simplest of labors, but it still managed to disappoint even there with a constant air of unreliability.","3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"And finally, the kicker, one month after my very expensive replacement plan runs out it completely falls apart, with sd errors that make it completely unable to use no matter which sd I use it for.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I spent months researching the best camera for my needs, but I suppose my conclusion was way off.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This camera has been a sour expensive experience since day one.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll stick to the cheap stuff from now on.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,At least they don't make you go broke for their shoddy craftsmanship.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My gopro hero 4 does not connect with my Samsung S6 phone!!!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,When chatting with the gopro team they said it is not compatible anymore!!!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Are u serious?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great Product!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I purchased my GoPro Hero 4 Silver for a winter trip to Montana.,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"But this thing can do it all, and the LCD touchscreen works perfectly.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The LCD is perfect for seeing what you are taping and framing your shots then it turns off after a couple minutes to save battery.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,If I would have went with the black i would be disappointed because without the LCD the GoPro is a little hard to navigate.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The battery works for about 1 hour 30-45min of filming in 1080p by 60 so do buy some extra batteries.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Cant wait to continue using this thing in all different sports and activities!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Â Took it with snorkeling in St John and worked great for me.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I'm happy with the photos and video, which is much better than other efforts.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,(Haven't figured out how to edit the video yet).,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,But the camera is relatively easy to learn to use.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I used an extension stick and floats.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Seeing the viewing screen is marginal when the camera is extended away from you, so make sure you practice so the point of view is what you want.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can see my angle was above the 'tang gang' and the shark surprise!,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,This is the 3rd replacement Hero 4 Silver camera I received from Amazon in a month.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,All 3 have the same 2 issues.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The all have the wifi helicopter sound issue and they get hot when used.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,So frustrated.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,After 3 months something going wrong and ita not working properly.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,No support from amazon or GoPro.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Need help in order to check what we should do,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love this camera!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The video is amazing and pictures are great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I tested the video on 1080 and 720 and both look great on a large flat screen TV.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I took it in the ocean and pool and the water proof cases worked perfect.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I would suggest getting some of the accessory attachments though.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The one I like the best is the floating handle.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,here are 3 cases and one is completely waterproof and one is more water resistant.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can't control the back of the camera settings with the completely waterproof case.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"With the water resistant case, you can sometimes change the settings, but sometimes not.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"This gopro was delivered on time and place Properly, but the item was not as satisfying as I expected.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I recorded some footage from snowboarding in the mountains which could be bumpy at times and unsteady, but I thought that this camera would solve at least a percentage of this issue.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Although, the gopro presented the footage without a bit of steadiness.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It was clear though!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Received the GoPro Hero 4 silver, with manufacturing defects does not work, to use the recommendation of the manufacturer had to buy a brand Lexar model 633x memory, I was able to upgrade the software and igualmanera still did not work, from the first day the camera it stays in the start menu and does not recognize the rest of the commands, I tried restarting of all forms and the camera does not work, additionally the camera when I arrived note that in one of the corners of the front frame right supeior was broken.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Please I need to be refunded my money, because the article does not work in any way.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If you're thinking about getting the Session or the HERO4 Black, DON'T do it.",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"The session has worse video quality than the two, and unless you really REALLY need a small cube, the Session is useless.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Black is GREAT for shooting in 4k... for 30 minutes before the battery dies on you.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Unless you're planning on taking 10 batteries with you, the Black isn't worth it.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"In addition, the HERO4 Silver has a LCD touchscreen, which (if you're into photography) you can line up shots and make sure your finger isn't in the way.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have taken an entire DAYS worth of photos and videos on the HERO4 Black before realizing I had something in the way.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Save $100 from the Black, and get the Silver  -Sincerely, from a GoPro and REI content creator.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Check out my shots on Instagram if you need examples of the quality.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,IG @joshmalech,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Yeah yeah - can you really not give this 5 STAR - yes.?,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Only I would like that it wasn't silver, hate that make it black or have inserts for color.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I took it for underwater with a Sony underwater camera ($200) which takes good shots already.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The wide angle and underwater expertise made this rule.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,However when deep underwater I got the green tint - sometimes- I guess in software white balance but really it ruined the video and I can't seem to take out that saturation in post.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Fix that for your star GoPro,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The Hero4 Silver is the best and only action cam I've ever used, but it's not without it's faults.",3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,Hard to tell if anything is in focus or if the colors are good.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,* Switching back and forth between two modes is a pain.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I can see why they added voice-commands in the next version * 2.7K at 30fps and 24 is awesome.,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,1080p60 is a little underwhelming.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,For actual slow-mo you have to go down to 960p.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"* If this camera drops in price a ton with the new release, you won't be disappointed at all.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Current price point though is way too much.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera freezes....,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have to take out the battery and put it back.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I do the same thing three or four times until it works,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,SO MUCH FUN FOR PICTURE LOVERS!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,GREAT UNDERWATER!,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,Every picture is flattering since no real closeups.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,No need for photo shopping cause every picture is flattering!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,BEST CAMERA for action.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Strong, well made, so many ways to enjoy it weather videoing in your car traveling, using the harness to attach to pets, its idiot-proof technology that is straight forward : press one button and PERFECT, and last but not least......","1,6",P,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Keep getting SD Card error and miss getting vids and pics that cannot be recaptured!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,coooool :),4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Very easy to navigate around the options but one thing I would highly recommend is 'get to know your gopro before your big adventure'.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Watching videos on tips on navigating and how to take selfie shots came in very handy.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I had the camera in the case a lot during our trip with the solid plastic door on it so the only way to get around the options was using the three buttons.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,After a few days of using the buttons I was able to navigate around pretty quickly.,"1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great shots and videos with both medium and wide angles.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Although don't expect the take great night pictures with this, they get very blurry but during the day is a completely different story.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Try it, you'll have a great time with it.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,OBSESSED.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,i take this thing everywhere.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,nothing more needs to be said about the quality and functionality - absolutely amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,one drawback though - battery life is pretty crap.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"have read all the stats on the website about usage times, but find this innacurate in real world use.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"eg: go on a hike - take a handful of of photos, and a few short videos, and the battery is almost depleted.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"always carry spares, but annoying to have to change so often","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I just received it but it looks great and my initial sample videos are excellent.,"1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The packaging is high quality as if you went and picked it up new at Best Buy.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This is my first GoPro and the quality and feel of the camera and accessories feels excellent.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It is nice and small and the fit within the housing is very precise.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I plan on documenting my experience on my motorcycle and enjoying various other activities like the dog park and fishing trips.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Can't wait to put it to use.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Only grip is I wish battery lasted longer.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It appears a fully charged battery will last about 2-4 hours depending on your resolution settings.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Great video quality and easy to use.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I was surprised how good actually.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The only complaint I have is that the battery is so small and weak and the camera as a whole is so small, that it doesn't work well in below freezing temperatures for things like skiing.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The battery dies very quickly in the cold...sometimes within just a few minutes.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera froze the first time it was used after charging the battery, I would seriously consider buying this model - research all the blogs about this unit freezing.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,When I sent it back in I was told that the warranty department had no units available to send.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,now that I have experienced this problem I did some research with people that I saw had bought a hero 4 and a majority of people said they had a similar problem.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Quite amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"So BEWARE, and do some research before buying.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Im an honest guy and I have to say I didn't wanna believe in the bad reviews so I took a chance.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Well for the record I wanna say I got SCREWED big time, Battery didn't wanna charge, When it was unplugged Red light said it was charging.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,If you have an important life event you want to record like I did don't count on this camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,WASTE of time and MONEY.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Youll have better video/pics through your phone.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,100% HONEST REVIEW!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I paid $300 for this camera which seemed to be the norm when buying the hero 4 silver new, but upon recieving the package it looked like it had been opened and resealed.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I ignored it, but after removing the camera from its housing I noticed how horribly scratched up the LCD screen is (picture attached).",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Very disappointed.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"So far the camera itself seems to be working fine, but I feel that it was refurbished and I've paid the price for what should've been brand new.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Quite the amazing device!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This was an upgrade from my Hero +...so you can imagine all of the features I am having to learn.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It was a toss up between the the Hero 4 Silver or Hero 5 and in the end I got the Hero 4 Silver because it suited the needs for which I was going to use it.,"3,4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I am videoing my races (5Ks to 1/2 Marathons for personal accountability and memories) I knew I wanted a gimbal and the Hero 5 is still having issues with the Karma and Microphone placement/sensativity.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I am very pleased with the performance so far!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,This appeared to be a refurbished model.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,From the start it would not turn off and on properly.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It still has functioned well enough for my 11 year old to enjoy it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I only got blurry pics.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Also did was not compatible with my MacBook.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Bought a Go Pro Hero 4 Silver on 5/16/2016 w/ 64gb Sandisk Ultra SD card.,"3,4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Got it last Sunday.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Unboxed the GoPro and installed the memory card.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Recorded some clips, probably 3-4 short clips and took few photos, probably about 5 sample pics just to test the camera.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I got disappointed because the camera froze on my very first use as I preview the shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Did a battery pull to restart the camera because the buttons wont respond.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Quite disappointing for a brand new product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Overall is a good camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,A little difficult to use and goes through batteries fast.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Had some issues with electronic interference that messed up some of my recording but was able to get replacement.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,For giving good video and fast shipping but screen freezing sometimes.,1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Need to remove battery to resolve the issue.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,im wondering if this is refurbished or not coz i chose 'NEW'.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Also, there is a big price difference from gopro website.","3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"If you want fast shipping, i recommend this.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,GoPro Hero 4 Silver Rocks!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"For the price,best in it's class for size, video quality and sound as far as I'm concerned.","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Will record audio in stereo with the optional external mic/line-in USB cable ($20).,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I like it and thinking of getting another one for hunting season.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I also purchased the GoPro Remote control which makes controlling the camera easy plus it will control up to 50 cameras (sweet!).,"1,4,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Record time is OK, about 2-3 hours but do yourself a favor and buy another or two extra batteries and maybe 2 or more 64GB Class 10 or better Micro SD Cards (This camera does not come with a Micro SD card).","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Well, I bought this because I saw some amazing videos taken in Maui and thought it would be fun to make them too!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Which, don't get me wrong, it was.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, the camera kept freezing, which is no fun when your diving or snorkeling or trying to view videos directly from the camera to the TV.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The camera gets hot, freezes and stops working.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I thought I may have a bad one, but when I started researching, I found this a typical complaint from other owners.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I would have tried to return this one to exchange for a new one, but I was on vacation and didn't have any of the original packaging with me to send it back by the 30 days.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Something else I didn't anticipate was the learning curve.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It was a little high for me since I'm not a photographer or videographer, just a little old!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,LOL.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I had to rely on youtube videos and the internet.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The manual that comes with it doesn't really tell you how to shoot movies or to take pictures, but I guess that's true with most cameras.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I just need a class!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Pros: small, takes great videos, HD, good for shooting outdoor activities Cons: gets hot, freezes when trying to watch videos directly through a TV, once I downloaded videos to my laptop, it converted to mp4, which isn't compatible with the GoPro Studio, the camera only takes wide or medium angle photos, large learning curve for me (could be cuz I'm old), so it took some time learning the buttons and using all the different settings.","1,2,5","P,C",Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Freezes up on playback!,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,What a waste of money.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,"Now that I'm home I can't get the hero4 to playback on the tv for more than 10 seconds without it bricking/freezing up despite trying multiple cables, HDMI and USB.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The screen turns blue and then I have to remove the battery to restart it!,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,What a piece of junk.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Playback interface is horrible, otherwise it seems to be a quality product.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is pretty bad.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I ended up using 2-3 batteries per day when the cam was mostly on standby.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,DON'T BUY - until GoPro updates the firmware to support playback.,"2,3",,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,3,They are aware of the problem and still haven't done anything to improve it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Now I'm past the 30d window to return and stuck with a relatively nice camera I can't easily watch.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The best action camera on the market!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It also works a great video camera replacement.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Like: - small and compact - waterproof housing - TONS of settings to get the perfect shot - expandable storage - replaceable batteries - free editing software for Mac + PC - mobile app is awesome for quick posts, edits, and control - new sensor can 'crop' the video image during recording to give a traditional video camera look (instead of the fish eye) - SLOWMO!!!!","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"- great 3rd party support Dislike: - expensive - many relatively inexpensive accessories aren't included standard (standard tripod mount, etc) - accessories are EXPENSIVE (most are just molded plastic) - battery life is wanting.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,1 hour of shooting isn't a lot - doesn't call my parents and check on them,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I dont like the design of go pro.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,2,The windows app on my Nokia 1520 WP8.1 is a non starter on either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I am totally disappointed, as my intended use depended on remote.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I have ordered the Smart Remote, which may somewhat suffice.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"If this major shortcoming is repaired, I will update my comments.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I purchased this camera recently to use on my trip to Costa Rica; the quality of the video at 1440 was excellent so I can imagine how much better it is at 2k.,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I easily viewed the videos on a TV using an HDMI cord which I had to purchase separately.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,One of my complaints is that the buttons to operate the camera are very small so I keep on pressing the record button by accident.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I also had an issue pressing the wrong button and kept on changing the camera mode to other than video.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Unfortunately, I did not notice this until after recording time lapse stills instead of a video; missed recording crossing over a rickety hanging bridge to get to a spectacular waterfalls.",4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,"(LOL)  My most recently problem involves the GoPro application for the computer (Windows 10 sucks); still working on this issue with the vendor and hope to resolve it soon because otherwise, I will not be able to work on/save my beautiful videos.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Purchased the GoPro HERO4 SILVER as a gift for my son.,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,"Freezing is an issue, as well as intermittent issues with not being able to record.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Current issue is it will not charge.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have contacted GOPRO directly and will update once I hear back.,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,"If you google GORPRO HERO Problems, this is not a remote issue, there are tons of people having problems with this camera.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I spent 3 hours trying to connect the WiFi on the camera to the phone app with no success.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Finally after talking to GoPro technical support they said the WiFi isn't working correctly and I had to send it back.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I might have saved a little money buying it through Amazon, but now that there is a problem, I have to mail it back and won't have the camera for christmas as I planned!",4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,2,First off this is a great little camera for pics and the quality is awesome.,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"But having said that I purchased this for video, and it does take the best video I have ever seen.","1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,But people be warned if you think you can take a video of an hour walk through the mountains or of a family get together and then burn it to a DVD you are in for a surprise.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Even on the lowest resolution {video is awesome} you will be way over the capacity of the 4.7 Gig DVD!,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was only able to get about 25 minuets of video to burn to a DVD.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I read a ton of reviews and nowhere did anyone talk about burning videos to a DVD.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I already have an awesome 12MP camera for pictures.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Even when I burnt a 25 minute video to DVD it did not play good on my fancy DVD home player.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,If anyone wants a barely used GoPro Silver and accessories let me know.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,If I would have been able to read about burning it to a DVD on their website or any info in the reviews I would not have purchased it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Shame on you GoPro for not telling people about this.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I bought this in the extreme bundle for 440.00.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Since the camera alone sells for 400 at most retailers, this is a GREAT deal!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"You get the camera, a micro sd card (doesn't come when you buy the camera alone), 3-way tripod, two extra batteries and a battery charger pack (off brand) and the headband mount.","1,4,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Overall it's a great deal for first time buyers who don't have any of the accessories which are a must for this camera.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Everything works well.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I do have to say I've had some issues with charging the battery pack.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It didn't come with an adapter for the wall and it doesn't want to charge on some adapters that I've tried.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Had to send it back twice for various malfunctions.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This camera is garbage.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,My GoPro doesn't suffer from the numerous hardware problems that others have experienced.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It just crashes all the time.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I keep hoping I may be able to connect it to the computer and somehow get a software update to fix this mess.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Kind of tricky to learn, but works great after figuring it out!",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It takes great still photos.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Bought the GoPro for a scuba dive trip to Mexico.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It worked well through 8 dives to 85 feet.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Video was pretty decent with good color using the WoCase Lens Filter.,"1,5,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Photos were not very good in general.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"On the 9th dive, in a Cenote (fresh water cave) with a max depth of 25 feet the case flooded about 20 minutes into the dive.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Since I was in a cave I could not surface immediately.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"So far, I have been unable to recover the GoPro.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It is sitting in rice.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,VERY unhappy with my choice to go with GoPro for SCUBA.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Makes sure you really want one before just buying what will essentially become a paper weight in you house.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I was skeptical about the video and photo quality until I actually downloaded the files to my phone through the app.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I give it 5 stars for that!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only problem I had was that having the screen on drained the battery pretty quickly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've yet to figure out how to turn the screen off to extend my battery life.,1,I,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I also accidentally put the camera in the wrong mode a couple times (user error.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,haha) so be conscious of that.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Other than that, it was a fantastic investment!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I used it for the first time on a recent trip to Costa Rica.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I went whitewater rafting, waterfall rappelling, hiking, swimming, you name it!","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It beautifully captured my whole experience and I would highly recommend purchasing one.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I replace a GO PRO 3 with this camera and I must say the difference in the quality of the pictures it takes is outstanding.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Lots of great feature too.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I had the Gopro hero 3 black for a couple do weeks and sold it and bought the hero4 silver as it boasted better lowlight capability.,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I used it at our recent trip to Disney and universal and most of my still pics came out blurred and unfocused .,"1,4,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,In normal light pictures look great!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But I was very disappointed in the quality of the pictures.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Video is also great in normal light!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I like the preview touch screen on the back of the hero4 silver.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,What to say about this piece of art.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I entered into action cameras by purchasing a low end alternative to gopro.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,When i must admit it did all it promises (sjcam 4000) it is not close the the features set your get with GoPro Hero4 silver.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This camera is just amazing.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has everything that hero4 black has plus a touch LCD so what else do you need?,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Black has addtional 4k recoding options that silver doesn't but to be honest- there is no limit to how much more you can want.,"1,4,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I own a full frame camera and it just never is enough.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"So, you gotta settle at some point and trust me for the action camera world, hero4 silver is the nissa GTR.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The best with a little lesser price point.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This GoPro continually overheats.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The unit gets so hot that I can't hold it in my hand and I'm afraid that it will start a fire.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Mi gopro never function!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Quite possibly the best purchase of 2014.,"4,3",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has lived up to the expectations and honestly beyond.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I gave it to my boyfriend, on thanksgiving, as an early christmas present bc we had a few trips planned and i thought it would be nice to break it out while we traveled.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Not only has it become an essential on the pack list but it goes everywhere with us.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,While the camera is amazing with excellent clarity and durability I figured a few accessories would be imperative to the quality/variety of photos.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"So far he has loved the Joby Gorillapod Flexible Tripod, CamKix telescopic pole 14' to 40', twin pack of extra batteries and charger, and a spare tripod mount.","1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Next on the list of accessories is the remote - while the gopro app has the option to set burst/continuous/video settings and take a picture it can take a minute to connect and is not ideal for all situations.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Highly recommend this camera - it is versatile.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I plan on gifting one to my father and mother who are less than tech savvy but love the great outdoors and live on the water with beautiful sunsets they look forward to capturing.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So I have been using the goPro Silver for a while now using just about every function it has.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So far I have been really impressed with the quality and recordings it produces.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have recorded video on most settings testing to see which one I like best, 2.7k 30p seems to be the sweet spot for everyday videoing for me.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Lets me crop with stabilization and downscale to 1080p and still have a crisp picture.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have used the nightlapse a few times  and have had good results after playing around with protune.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,In the picture settings I have used timelapse to make a few motion lapse videos and they have actually turned out pretty good as well.,"1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,However you you are doing just a regular timelapse I would use the new video function for it and shoot in 4k.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,One thing I would say to new buyers buy the Wasabi extra batteries and charger combo for 19.99 (at the time I purchased) and a external battery pack for longer shoots.,"1,4,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Trust me 1 battery is not enough.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"unfortunately I am not a huge fan of GoPro, this is my second product from them and I have found you are simply paying for the name, nothing more.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Took terrible pictures unless it was perfect lighting and on some forum of tripod.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Video was fantastic though.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The product didn't work, and I had to return it.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The GoPro HERO4 Silver is my favorite GoPro so far.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Built-in screen makes this the perfect recreational camera for those looking to get better photo and video with less effort.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Battery life is comparable to most of the other 4s.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have taken this to the beach, river, skiing, overseas, and just out on the town with friends.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for my professional video work and for personal keepsakes with my family and friends.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The two best accessories I bought for this were the production mount and the Wasabi Power Battery 2 Pack.,"1,5",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Gaining added recording time and always having a spare battery makes the camera much more valuable.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love the ease of use with the updated GoPro app and the functionality of the high res video and time lapse features.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The battery will not charge no matter how many troubleshooting steps I follow!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery duration is very poor specially if wifi is enabled to connect with a goPro app or the remote control.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It can't replace a regular camera given that doesn't provide zoom (neither digital and analog),"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Awesome camera,  very fun to video my koi fish and off-roading .",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"One downfall so far is the go pro on my Samsung Galaxy s5 will not pair to my go pro , with such a new  piece and big price of equipment there should be no Filmware error.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I have restarted the WiFi at least 4 times.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Help would be appreciated!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Wish their was an easier way to take selfies.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,3,For thre casual user (on vaca) I don't want to carry around this and my phone to use the app.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,this is the worst Camera I have ever bought.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have not played with it that much but I brought it with me to Comic con and I will never bring it with me again.,"3,4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I was clade I brought a back up.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I would return it but I already pulled the stickers off.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,You had better hope what ever you want to film is within 2-3 of you.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's been a great little camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Wish the sound could be better in waterproof case like the session,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Amazing camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love shooting in 1080p super view mode and getting the wide field of view.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The footage is very clean and stable.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The touch screen options are intuitive and easy to use.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I much rather use this one than the black, the screen helps a lot.","1,3,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I can't wait to go on more adventures with it,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"This isn't the product I was sold, by comparing the silver and black addition gopro hero 4, the major difference is that hero silver has a LCD tuch screen and Black addition doesn't.","1,5",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"But I do now own a GoPro Hero 4 silver and it is user friendly and extremely versatile, great for beginners!","2,3,4",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Ummm.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Where do I start?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Let me start by saying I receive my package super early.,"4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,4days before original delivery date.,"4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Bought it for a Valentines Day gift for my boyfriend.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Came sealed, new and all accessories were included.","4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I was so excited receieving this product and even more excited about how perfect it was.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,My boyfriend will love this gift.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Thank youuuuuu,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The housing that came with the go pro lasted one day and the hinge broke off and cracked after closing the case.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I've had the hardest time with this camera freezing up!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I have friends with previous models and he doesn't have this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I googled and it's a common issue no good fix for it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's a very good product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, it's high time GoPro reduced its price.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,There is a lot of good competition at one-third price that cannot be ignored to remain in the market.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The other thing that baffles me is why can't the sensor size be increased for better low light performance especially at this price point.,1,I,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,its freezing up on me,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I bought this for a trip to Mexico and it was everything I needed.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Waterproof, small form factor, took great photos and very high quality HD video.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I got the package deal with 2 extra batteries and a charger for the same price as just the camera so you can't beat that!,"1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Batteries last about 2 hours of filming which I found to not be an issue with the extra 2 I got in the package.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The camera itself is great I love the display on the back and it was super easy to get it set up and take great high quality video.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If your looking for a small 'Action Camera' don't get a knock off, buy the real deal!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Highly recommend!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"the box was smashed when i go it, good thing the camera is can handle abuse.","1,7",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Poor image quality on the LCD, with stripes.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Let's hope Hero5 is of better quality,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Had this for a year+ now and must say I continue to be impressed by the quality of the shots I get (given it's size and lens).,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have a couple of DSLR bodies and lens - both capable of HD movies - but this GoPRo is my 'goto' choice for movies.,"3,4,5,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It is also my goto choice for wide angle shots (what it is built for) and of course, I use it when I will encounter water that would kill my DSLR's.","1,5,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Got a great movie of a waterfall - from the bottom on a boat - even though I was getting drenched.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The only negative is the 'sparsity' of buttons - even thing is controlled by 3 buttons and that takes a bit of getting used to.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,But it is pretty much required by the waterproofing.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I also use it for 'candid' street shot photography with a belt or shoulder strap attachment.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm overwhelmed from all the settings and options.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I suppose that can be a good thing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But I like to keep it simple.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,My favorite is the super slow mo.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Don't buy unless you're into wet action sports like snowboarding, surfing, diving, outdoors, etc.","3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's an expensive toy otherwise.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Go Pro Studio also takes some time to learn and you have to download it for windows - takes up a lot of resources.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I love this camera!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is my first camera purchase since my Nikon CoolPix S630.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I bought it primarily for the pool and beach but find myself taking it everywhere now.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Before purchasing I went back and forth contemplating this one and the Session model.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Even at twice the price I think it was worth it to get the HERO4 Silver.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The back screen is great so you can actually see what you are recording.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Not to mention the kids always want to see themselves so the playback function is really nice.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Be sure to get extra batteries and memory cards if you plan on recording all day long.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"With a 64gb card you will get around 4hrs at 1080p, less at higher resolution of course.",1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This camera has lived up to the hype I have been hearing about for yrs.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Just be aware, purchasing this camera will make you want to record everything in life.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Battery exploded,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Decent quality video if there's enough light but not extremely high so not great for Pro-End looks.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I, like many before, experience a problem with a helicopter sound in the video.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I read others' issue and saw that calling CS helped them out... Maybe they got sick of all the returns because when I called they gave me a long list of requirements I had to do (recording video and send to them) to prove I wasn't lying.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,In the end I just decided that I don't even care about the audio from my GoPro so wasn't worth the red tape they were binding me with to get fixed/replaced.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The GoPro gets hot and stops working within 20 minutes.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The battery needs to be pulled to reset.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Once reset it can be use for a few more minutes maybe 10 minutes and then it looks up again.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"This past summer, I bought the Hero4 Silver GoPro for my trip to Southeast Asia.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The quality was great, but a week into the trip, the housing case's attachment tab broke off while unscrewing the GoPro from the headpiece.","1,4","C,P",,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This ruined every shot for the rest of the trip because I was not capturing even shots (the camera was tilted).,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera was a Christmas gift that we bought in august.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The battery will not charge and now i find out cant return it.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,One of the best investments I've made this year.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Because of its convenience and sturdy case I dare to take it with me to events where delicate cameras would be at risk.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The GoPro is good at capturing action and delivers really nice 'non fisheye' footage as wel.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Performs great at daytime, not so good in low light conditions.","1,3",R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If you plan to record audio you should consider using an external microphone, or only film in quite environments so you can boost volume during editing.",6,,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,While using the closed case you shouldn't bother trying to record any audio.,"1,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The screen is small but really nice.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Settings can be easily changed on the go and even playback is decent on the tiny screen.,2,,Information Giving,

B00NIYJF6U,3,i love the gopro camera!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I had a gopro hero 3 for 2 years and I decided to upgrade for the gopro 4.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It came today and the wifi side button is not workng and also the charger usb is not working properly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Being used to GoPro from the beginning, this is par for the course.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's a damn good course to be exact.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's  hard to grade this since all GoPro cameras work great in the latest generation.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The camera is great for the intended purpose.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I have purchased several knock-offs previously and now I wish I had paid for the GoPro to begin with.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Clearly many features that give this camera a big advantage.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Only issue is the attachments are plastic and cheap.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Be careful or you will loose the camera.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The camera is of pretty good quality and does the tasks I need it to do.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The editing software however is horrible.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It continuosly crashes during trimming videos wasting my time over and over.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It is very frustrating.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is horrible.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Ordered this because I bought a new 2016 Toyota Tacoma and one of the selling features of the truck was 'go pro ready'.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Which amounts to a plastic mount in place on the windshield!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,What a gimmick.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The first go pro ordered, would record for a little over an hour, then dead.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera became so hot I could hardly touch it to get it out of the case.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Returned it and another one came very quickly.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The time it took me to set up the first one, package it to send back, coordinate with UPS and then set up the second one ... and it won't hold a charge either.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Something about this camera or faulty battery is absolutely ridiculous, and what a huge price to pay for junk!","1,3",C,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,"$400 and more of my time to try and make this work, potential of setting up another one?",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Don't have time to keep messing with this expensive equipment that doesn't deliver!!,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I bought it to take it on my runs with me when I leave my phone behind, and am a bit disappointed in the image quality of stills: Moving objects come out blurry every single time, despite the dedicated burst mode.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,

B00NIYJF6U,2,I would put up with it if the pictures came out better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It just doesn't seem like they used a good image sensor.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I am sure it's a great camera for action videos, but again, I just need something small that takes great pictures, and the Hero 4 isn't it.","1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I will say that pictures come out slightly better than on my Polaroid Cube.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Something else that irks me is the fact that despite a bazillion accessories out there, there is no way to attach a lanyard to the camera if I use it without the waterproof case, which I don't need, and which would make the camera too bulky.","3,5",,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"Using the video back is much, much easier.",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"You can also replay recorded clips with the back, so you can review what you just shot without having to figure out how to get the video onto another device to view.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This is extremely important and allows you to be confident that you really got the shot you wanted.,"2,4",,Information Giving,

B00NIYJF6U,4,I does it job on capturing moments.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,One little problem for me is the cracking of the front faceplate.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,I'm giving 3 stars only cause the battery was drained within 2hrs of use.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,Love it but mature users with less than stellar vision beware.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It is next to impossible to read the menu on such a tiny screen.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The menu LCD is dark grey writing on a light grey background.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Not a big deal if you are navigating via the touch screen but with the waterproof case the touchscreen is not available.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,No back light on the tiny front menu screen makes it difficult to read it indoors and impossible  in outdoor bright light.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,2,At first I wan't sure about purchasing it due to some reviews of recieving a defective camera with a purple screen and was debating on getting it locally.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"However, I have been using the camera a lot in the past couple weeks and not one problem.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The reason for giving it a two star is the battery.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I believe I recieved a bad battery, it doesn't last long at all.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'lll have it fully charged and in a few minutes it drops from 100% to 70% then about 25 minutes it will go completely dead.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,When I first got it I fully charged the battery before turning it on and using it and it did this the first time using it.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Ever since I got it iv been fully charging it and letting it fully die and nothing is changing.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Over all I love the camera and I'm glad I got it, just it was a major let down about the battery and having to stay close to an outlet.",1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have not been impressed with the GoPro at all.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This is the first GoPro I've had and I've found that it freezes up during the middle of a recording (and I take like 5 minute max videos) and the image quality is pretty poor.,"1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It is small and lightweight but to me that is where the pros stop.,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Not sure if something is wrong with the one I ordered for my husband or if he just has no clue how to use it.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"After charging the battery, it went dead after only a few minutes.",1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"The only thing I wish for is that they update the camera so you can mute the audio while recording , that would be a plus, it would reduce the wind noise, tomorrow I'm going to hit the ocean with it for the first time, I'm sure all will work out fine , I already can see I'll be coming an GoPro action hero, and it will become a good exercise machine.","2,4",,Feature Request,

B00NIYJF6U,5,What more can you say about GoPro they had the top-of-the-line when it comes to action cameras.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I've experienced the same excellence than many thousands and millions of people have experienced with the GoPro hero's silver.,"3,4",,,

B00NIYJF6U,2,"I'm going to sell it to a pawn shop and buy one with a warranty, since the seller offered zero and little to no real return policy.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I love my GoPro, but the helicopter noise is simply not acceptable.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It has been widely reported and GoPro still hasn't fixed it yet.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We're in the Maldives for our once in a lifetime vacation and our brand new GoPro HERO4 isn't working!,"3,4",,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,"GoPro support responded with 'From the information you have provided, I would say, not for sure yet, that the problem is your SD card, can you please send us a photo to check which one you have.'",8,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,My first GoPro.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Haven't tested underwater but any video or photo I've shot I've really liked.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,"Speaking of options, that's one downside I've found.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,There are many (for a novice) to choose from.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I find myself missing or delaying moments because I'm trying to decide what video or photo mode to use.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I understand I'll learn with practice but to me the GoPro's appeal is it's ability to capture 'in the moment' and I think I've missed some of those while fiddling with 'super-wide at 1080p 60fps or medium 1440 48fps?',"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,type decisions.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I use my camera with Wifi on, there is a pulsing audio sound captured in the recording.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,A quick Google search reveals this was a widely known problem by that GoPro was aware of at least a year before I bought by camera.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It has been 18 months since I bought my camera.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Today is the first time I used the Wifi and I discovered the problem.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Even though it's past the warranty period, I'm going to submit a warranty claim to GoPro.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I'll update my review if they make it right and fix my camera or send me a new one.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"If they won't take care of what was a known issue before they sold me my camera because I didn't submit a warranty claim within 12 months, I'll never use their products again.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It's a shame because I was happy with this product until I found this out today.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is a great video camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The film quality is pretty amazing as you can tell by all the other reviews.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only issue we have are that the sound capture is not great if you have the case on and it is mounted.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,You tend to get lots of squeaking in the joint area that can make the sound suck.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I guess that why all the Go Pro videos have music added to them.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Also this is not that good for still pixs.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,We tend to go back to our Iphone for still pics.,5,,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,"NOT GOOD when I'm in the middle of skiing, bicycling or hiking.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The last thing I want to do is tech support.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,This is the only way I can tell if I have it pointed at the right elevation.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I took video of an entire bike trip with the camera tipped too far down because the GoPro would not sync with the iPhone and I couldn't tell how it was pointed.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Its ok.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery drains fast.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Also didnt come with gopro cd like other gopros do.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,My dad ordered his gopro from amazon and still got the cd even tho it wasnt listed.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Took this baby on our overseas vacation and it worked great!,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,We have great underwater videos and action photos/videos.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's durable, light, and easy to  carry everywhere.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Tried to use as an indoor camera in low lighting and found out that wasn't the optimal condition for this camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Definitely an outdoor camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It came with a head mount and chest mount that we didn't really have a use for.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Bought a separate monopod for the GoPro which we used 90% of the time.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love that you can preview the pictures and videos and delete unwanted pics/vids before wasting time uploading them.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It takes some great fisheye videos and yes the battery sucks.,1,"C,P",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm sure you read this elsewhere.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,What annoys me the most is that it uses USB mini instead of micro.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Now it's another cable to carry around.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Open the camera connected it to my phone.,2,,Information Giving,

B00NIYJF6U,1,Called Go-pro for help and was assisted with a manual install that did not help.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Go-pro then wanted me to complete the warranty and replace the unit I had.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I am returning this product if this is my first introduction to their product and it could not work then I do not want to own this.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Love it so far.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Square lens had some dust on the inside which I noticed after taking a few sample videos and pictures and viewing them on the computer.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Took a Q-tip and cleaned dust out the best I can without removing the square housing lens.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Better but not perfect like it should be.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Camera without housing is crystal clear.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Would have given it 5 stars if quality control was better for the housing.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,May be a defect in the flat glass.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's unbelievable how much is packed into this tiny camera... Technology is really something.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, GoPro dominates this market and thus can charge whatever they want.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"At this price point, you'd expect your gear to not freeze up regularly, batteries to last for more than a few hours, etc... 4 stars simply because it is a great product...","1,2,3","C,R",Information Giving,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"Yes there are much cheaper options available out there that are advertised as similar, but if you're serious about shooting quality videos spend your money on this.","3,4",,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,Cons- It still needs a housing to be waterproof and the battery redesign means you can't use your old batteries and battery life will still be too short for some especially when you keep the touch screen display on (it drains the battery even more).,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,No option for in-camera digital image stabilization.,2,C,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Over all I am happy with the purchase and the handy new features including a touchscreen, makes it one of the best little action cameras around.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Loved the idea of videoing my trip to Boundary Waters, but camera got damp (not wet) and hasn't worked since.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Not sure what to do about it.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Shipping & packaging were fine,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,New to Go Pro and was excited to get the camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Just received the camera and out of the box the touchscreen had 25% dead pixels along one side of the screen.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Will return through Amazon, hope for the best with the replacement.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"So far not impressed with the quality control of the product,",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Having nothing but trouble with the WIFI, Amazon won't take it back, I may have to fight about this one","1,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I purchased a new GoPro.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This came in a package that had been open and package torn and very worn on the corners.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I sent it back immediately.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Great product, my only concern is the waterproof housing isn't 100% waterproof.","1,3",I,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Still awesome would recommend it to everyone.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Best when purchased with the smart remote and go pole.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I did a ton of research before buying this camera and was aware of the many reports of the hero4 silver freezing and becoming completely unresponsive.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"It seems from the reports I've read, that the solution in every case was to ship thing to gopro under warranty and they replace it and maybe you will get a good one.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I thought just maybe I would get a good one since they have been out a while now.... Nope.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,nothing but issues.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My SD card is officially supported and is one of the fast cards you can buy today.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Rather than jack with shipping back and forth and dealing with the hassle of that whole mess, I just returned the dang thing to Amazon and went to my local Best Buy to get one and hope for the best.","4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Well, the one from Best Buy has tested great so far.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I guess it's just a roll of the dice with this model.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I figured if i got another bad one it would much easier to just go back to the local store.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,top latch broke in a month of light use,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Video is great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"But if you take photo, the photo quality is really not as good as I expect.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I think the photo quality is worse than my Galaxy Note 4.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Considering the high price tag, I give it 3 stars.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"(BTW, GPro stock is only $12 now.)",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Does everything I want and need as advertised.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Doesn't replace a point and shoot camera for getting landscape shots, but excellent for action video, wide angle landscape shots, selfie shots, and time lapses.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Gopro editing software leaves a bit to be desired but the camera is exactly what you expect.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have had it for about 6 months and have taken it on my dirtbike helmet for some trails and fields, strapped it to the exoskeleton of a buddy's off road vehicle for some river trails and rock climbs, put it on the dash when we rented a car overseas and got some sweet time lapse video, and carried it on several hikes and a few other adventures.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Wouldn't have been able to do most of these with any other camera.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,LCD does make framing easier.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Though it sucks the battery down fast,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Clearly not a hero 4,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Love this thing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for scuba diving with red filters.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"What I like most is I no longer spend time getting the perfect shot, I just take a video and crop a picture out of the video.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It makes diving much more pleasant for me and my dive buddies, no more kicking coral or separating from the group.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"You don't need an extension stick, just get a hand held wand.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I am a pilot, and I am using it to video my flights.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It is costly for a camera, and low battery life, and somewhat more complicated than expected, but getting past that, a handy tool for filming activities.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Very choppy,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Delivery was prompt but prior to even opening up the standard plastic housing, I could see a scratch over the lens area.",7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,After opening up the housing I could confirm that the scratch was on the camera lens itself - and it was a deep scratch.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Either GoPro lacks proper product inspection processes or it had already been returned and they tried to pawn it off to an unsuspecting new buyer.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I didn't need to buy it online so I'm wondering why I did.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll return it and buy one from a brick & mortar retailer where I can visually inspect it first; probably a good practice for all pricy electronics.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I returned the Hero 4 Black and got this one instead.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The battery life is still not the greatest but this camera has the Built-In Touch Display (hint, reason why the Silver is not great on battery life), which makes it 100 times easier to use than the Black version.",1,"C,P",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The display is very easy to use and pictures quality is really nice.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I still think these GoPro cameras are over priced but I like this one a lot.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Cannot wait to use it for snorkeling in South Florida!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I received the camera a couple of days ago and was happy with the condition, that is until I charged the product and turned it on.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera kept freezing on me and has glitches on the images.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Just think about watching snow on a TV and that's what you have with the screen display.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Not happy with this purchase at all.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera worked perfectly for 4 months, then it freezes and you are not able to take pictures.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have purchased two different microSD cards from the Gopro recommended list and updated the camera firmware.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Really disappointed with the product and the worst is that I have missed really great shots during different trips, because the camera simply freezes.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I LOVE the Hero4 Silver.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I had a GoPro Hero but wanted to upgrade to something a little better to take to horse shows and on trail rides.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It is perfect!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have taken it swimming, to multiple countries, and on some wild adventures.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has held up with 0 problems.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Just remember to save battery life by turning the LCD screen off.,"1,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I will be purchasing a second one soon!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"First of all as an owner of old Hero 2 series, this new series is beyond compare.","4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The challenge was to chose between black and silver edition but now I am very satisfied with my choice for silver edition since; - Too much investment needed to play and edit 4K films and I am not quite sure whether the difference between 4K and 1920x1080 is that significant especially if there is no TV and/or monitor capable of showing 4K - Silver edition very slim and its back built in LCD panel is perfect and for black edition you have to pay another 80.- USD,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Won't work with any of my micro sd cards and didn't come with one.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Worked for 2 months and started freezing.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Now i am dealing with GoPro support team for an exchange and missing out on capturing the moments for which i paid this money.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I bought the GoPro Hero 4 Silver and I have never been more disappointed in a product!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera keeps freezing up even after updating the firmware severally.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I send my complaint to gopro and they have asked me to send it back for an exchange only problem is that I am in Nigeria and I will probably be charged AGAIN for custom fees.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I wish I didnt buy the damn thing!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Don't make the same mistake I did!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Battery Life and Remote are problems Camera and video seem to fit my needs, but the battery life is only good for 1-2 hours not much use if you want to capture something on film that may not happen right away and don't bring extra batteries (think of a fishing trip).",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The wi-fi remote is terrible as far as charging holding a charge 1 star or lower if there were such a rating.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"My experience with the remote has lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 and could go lower depending on GoPro's technical support, I guess I find out what kind of company I'm dealing with soon.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Buyer beware.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,For many this camera freezes up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I used my successfully 1x and the next time that I wanted to use the camera, it freezes and will do nothing.","1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I followed Go Pro instructions to try and solve the issue and no success.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Be sure to check out Youtube videos on the number of people who have had this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It is a great little camera if you do not get a lemon.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"If you do, you are stuck with it if out of warranty so be sure and get the warranty rather than be out $400.00.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have purchased two of these cameras and neither one of them worked for external audio.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have a drawer full of microphones and microphone adapters and none of them work.,"1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I recently purchased a Drift ghost S it has a 3.5 mm microphone Jack on it no need for an adapter I do not know why GoPro can't build their cameras the same.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The video is excellent though but not being able to run a microphone into my helmet is a problem for me.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I purchased the GoPro HERO4 Silver for my wedding videography business at the beginning of the wedding season.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I was reluctant, because I had heard mixed reviews and I wasn't sure how it would fit into my business necessarily.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I decided to give it a chance, and it was one of the best business decisions I've ever made!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"This camera is an absolute blast, and something that I've recommended time and time again to friends and family.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We use several HD cameras while shooting wedding footage, and I was concerned about the quality of the GoPro not stacking up..",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I was pleasantly surprised, and to be honest blown away by the quality of this compact camera!","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We've had a great time with it, and utilize it for the difficult shots!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,We've also recently started handing off the GoPro to members of the wedding party to take on the dance floor to capture some dancing footage!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We would have NEVER dreamed of handing off our equipment, but the GoPro is so indestructible we feel confident we can share it!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Our clients love that we've started doing this, because it adds a great perspective and we love that clients feel comfortable using the camera!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's so user friendly, we never have to explain it to anyone!",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,They generally just have a sense of how to use it right away!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I've used the GoPro on several hikes, kayaking, and on various adventures!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I'm so impressed by this company, and I would love to have 5 more GoPros!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I would recommend this to parents wanting to start their kids off with a great / fun camera, serious adventurous looking for a camera that is up for the challenge, photographers, videographers, filmmakers!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Basically, anyone looking for a great investment and something that will hold up!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's a tiny camera, but incredible power!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So impressed!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Good for underwater photography, OK for video.","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The case does not have a eyelet for securing the lanyard found on the red lens (used for better colors when diving) which seems bizarre considering how much this thing costs.,1,"C,R",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Hence the outer case needs some work.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This will not go into night mode automatically when going from outside a wreck to inside the wreck...a costly lesson for a Gopro noob like me.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I got this a few days before an overseas diving trip and the printed material provided is kinda crappy.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Yea, I know go online...well in a developing country that is easier said than done.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I simple sheet explaining basic functionality would have be great, but the Gopro gerus don't think so.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They would rather spend money on fancy packaging.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Go online...yea try that overseas.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It works good on land as well.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"It takes okay photos, but nothing spectacular.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Lack of zoom is disappointing.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Video is great, as is the underwater capability.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I only gave it three stars  because the outer case scratches EXTREMELY easily.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I've had several sport-type underwater cameras over the years, and never had one that looked so bad after one week of use.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I am a casual snorkeler, and it was in a case when not in use.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,There is no way a 'sports' camera should look this bad after a week of light use.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love this thing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I was really reluctant to buy one because I am not going to strap a camera to a bicycle or my head or anything like that.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for the family and I am very happy.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The size and video quality is great and I carry it almost everywhere.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If I have any complaint is that if you want to use it outside the housing, it is not well protected, and it is easy to accidentally get finger prints on the lens.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I bought a metal protective housing that includes a UV filter and lens cap that makes me feel a little safer.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Again, I am really happy with the product overall and will most assuredly buy future models.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,What to say about these cameras...The video quality is really good as we can see everywhere in youtube and having a display really helps fine tune the camera position.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,As the display  turns off after 1 minute it won't drain all the battery.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The only con is the sound noises caused by the camera shaking inside the box, it could have something already installed out of the factory to avoid these shocks so I wouldn't need to worry about putting something in there to fix it.",1,"C,R",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It just doesn't fell right to install rubbers and sponges on a brand new camera case to have any chance to use the sounds captured by the Hero4 Silver..,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The good thing about gopros are there versatility.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Built in screen is great in this!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,4k is only fps so just think of it as no 4k.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I always film at 1080p at 60fps.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Having the appropriate mounts and cases for your use are important.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I would spend ~100 additional on those and extra batteries and charger.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"to take filming to the next level, get a feiyu tech g4 gimbal.",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Everything is there, except for the waterproof housing even though it was advertised under the features and details and was also shown in the picture.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Needs image stabilization badly, End up with the Sony version because of this.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Picture quality was ok.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Product gets very warm when using for some reason.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is not great.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I can see the appeal for some with this product, but it was lacking some very key features found in comparably priced products,","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I love my Go Pro, just wish the battery lasted longer and had a flash.",1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Make sure your computer can handle the high resolution settings, otherwise you may not be able to watch your videos unless you record them with the 720 setting.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Most newer computers can handle the 1080P just fine.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Older computers, not so well.","5,8",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Hi GoPro team, I'm really sad because my camera was damage since the first day.","1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I could take some photos, not good at all because the camera began to be blocked, the screen was black and the buttons didn't work.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I had high expectations because I was going to use it the first time in a trip but it was a bad experience.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Would it be possible to have a support contact to fix it or have a new camera or have my money back.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Please let me know any comment or a photo or video as a support.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My mail is dca134@gmail.com Thank you!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Diana Ariza,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I bought the GoPro 4 Silver with the idea in mind that I was buying the best camera of this type available.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It turned out that it's a nightmare to set up and just didn't deliver on picture quality.,2,C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Note that this camera only downloads wirelessly, that's one point not made in all the tutorials and advertisements never mentioned.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The GoPro App download was different for different iPads I had, and totally wrong for one of them.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Couldn't connect wirelessly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"In general, I can't recommend buying this camera to anyone who can't spend two or three days messing around with it to get it to work...and maybe a few more days to get it to work properly...if at all.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was so stoked to buy a GOPRO camera because they are supposed to be rugged.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Well I wouldnt know because I havent taken mine outside yet and it is already broken.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I started to get these pink lines in the LCD screen and then it just freezes up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,You have to remove the battery to turn it off.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I figure no big deal its brand new I'll just send it back.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,When my new one arrives it is doing the same thing after about 3 hours.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I am now waiting on my  3rd camera in the mail.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,GOPRO has excellent tech support and sent me a new camera right away so we will see what happens next but.... All I can tell you is that make sure you get a micro SD card from GOPRO's recommended list.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The speed of the card is very important.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'm not sure if my card corrupted both cameras (which i have never heard of before) or if I got 2 faulty cameras so far.,"1,4",I,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I ordered a new sandisk extreme 64 gig card to try with my new camera.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Fingers crossed.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Not that it really matters.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,the vacation I bought this camera for came and went a month ago.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Before you buy this camera Google GoPro freezing problems....,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'm not the only one with this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll update this review to let you know how it all plays out.,8,,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Bought this thinking it had a five day batter life.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I think we may have received a defective one because the battery drains within hours.,"1,7",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I really like this smartwatch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I was mainly looking for an exercise/activity tracker that can also serve as a watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Apple watch was too expensive and I recently made a switch to Galaxy S7 Edge, so I decided to go with the Fitbit Blaze.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The most amazing feature is that it tracks your sleep automatically so you can just wear it after you shower at night and just fall asleep.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,It will automatically log your sleep data and sync it with your computer/phone/tablet.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Only 'flaw' of this watch, in my opinion, is that it is not water proof.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,This is a watch that I wear to the gym everyday and I wish I didn't have to take it off prior to showering and I wish I could wash my hands freely without worrying about getting too much water on this thing.,"1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Other reviews suggest, however, that one can wear this device in shower.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have not yet tried that myself.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Much better than the fit bit HR.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Longer battery life, large dial, more sensitive to footsteps.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Still, it doesn't register walking while pushing a shopping cart with your left hand.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Somewhat inaccurate on stairs, especially if you hold the banister with the watch hand.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Still, better than the others I've heard about.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This is a great idea and everything on the watch works great except the HR monitor.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I absolutely love the features and everything the watch does except the HR monitor.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The HR monitor was the main reason I wanted the watch so I could get rid of my chest strap HR monitor.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch did very well at tracking HR while running but did a terrible job while I was lifting weights.,1,"C,P",,
B019VM3F2M,2,I would be in the middle of my lift and look down and the monitor would be stuck on 64 bpm when I know it should be up around 110ish.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"All the other features including the calorie tracking were very good and I liked a lot, but if I can't track my workouts then it is no good to me.",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I've been holding off on the review just to check things out 1st, well, my review is the battery life is absolutely terrible.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"The watch itself, not the best but not bad.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I have to charge this every 3 days, completely dead.....",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This is a nice little gadget to have if your trying to live a more active life.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love that I can track and graph my progress with the app as well.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I've had my Blaze for a little over a month and I've lost 16lbs...,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It helps keep me moving and motivated!,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"If you're thinking about buying this, just do it!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,You won't regret it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The app is amazing and easy to use.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,You can make 'friends' and compete to get the most steps.,2,,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,4,The first one didn't last 30 days either.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"We thought that one had a defect so we returned it, but turns out this one didn't last much longer before its no good.","3,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I am so disappointed because My husband and I both loved our fit bits.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have a Charger 2 and have not had any problems at all with this model.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It was promptly replaced with a new one and my husband and I still love out FitBit!,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I had put off buying a Fitbit for several years, not seeing the value in them.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Finally, I Decided that I wanted to keep track of where my heart rate was during the day and night so I bought the Fitbit purely for that but it has been so much more!",6,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I use it as a watch, as a motivation for getting 10,000 steps in a day and have challenges with my friends which has been so much fun.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,My fitness level has improved and even my sleep has improved because I saw when I was waking up and decided to make some changes before bedtime to help my sleep.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The face is so easy to read and you can customize it to different faces to what works best for you.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Would recommend anyone purchase a Fitbit!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Positives: FitBit Blaze provides much more accurate numbers when you are counting calories because it gives you real time updates even when you are sitting still.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,The design is beautiful and very appealing to look at.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you are not running a constant sync with your phone, the battery lasts me 3-4 days per charge which is a huge plus on smart watches.","1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The HR monitor seems very accurate when comparing it to a manual test.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Negatives:  I have had this product for just over a month and I am constantly plagued with sync issues with my iPhone.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I am extremely tech savvy, so I can't imagine how frustrating it would be for someone who is not.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"There was a week straight where even when I would go through the troubleshooting process, it would not sync.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"This doesn't seem like a deal breaker, but if the battery runs out, there is no way to display the correct time without syncing it!",2,,Problem Discovery,Resource Utilization/Functional Suitability?
B019VM3F2M,3,"(You can sync it to the computer, but I think that defeats the purpose of the bluetooth functionality.)",6,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"My only solution has been to delete the app, make the iPhone 'forget' the device, and restart from scratch.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I've had to do this probably 7-8 times in the past 4 weeks.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I haven't heard any issues with other phones, but if over the next week I continue to have syncing issues, I will be returning this product.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Half the time it can't locate my phone for sync when I ride my bike.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Sometimes it just stops tracking and I lose the physical workout data.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,I'm not convinced it is actually tracking correctly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Very frustrating to use this watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The only thing it does seems to do accurately is record heart rate.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,1,Very disappointed in band size.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,I followed the instructions carefully and the band is way too big.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,I contacted Fitbit and they said I would need to work through Amazon to get an exchange.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"If I had purchased through Fitbit, they could have done a band exchange.",7,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"Problem was Fitbit didn't have what I wanted in stock, but Amazon did.",7,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Bummer.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,My suggestions: Don't order via Amazon.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"If you are inbetween sizes, don't order up as suggested.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"I sync this with my Samsung Galaxy Note 4,and it is a daily chore.","2,5,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,"After one year, of trying all kinds of tricks, including rebooting the phone, rebooting the Blaze, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I give up.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,"I'll wear it as a watch, but I've uninstalled the app permanently.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,I realized it was a daily irritant; who needs that?,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,!,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"This was a huge impulse buy, but I'm glad I did it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Lots of great features beyond the usual step/calories/time aspects.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"As a student nurse, I take my Fitbit with me on the unit (after cleaning it) and I use the stopwatch feature to take vitals.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I love the plum band and that the watch allows me to specify whichever type of exercise I'm currently doing (elliptical, treadmill, running, etc) to get maximum accuracy.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Also really enjoy the FitStar workouts available on the watch, although I wish there were more than just a few to choose from.",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Cons: Although I fit the watch to my wrist as per the instructions, the back of the watch face  keeps abrading my skin and causing redness and irritation.","1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,If I secure the band any looser it's much too loose for accuracy.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I also find it exceedingly difficult to clean.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I love the watched itself but I'm a bit disappointed in the battery life.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I get about two days on it if I'm lucky and all the notifications are turned off.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,If I turn on notifications it's charging every day.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Also for some reason this one takes longer to link up with my Android phone where my HR2 linked up without issue and very quickly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I do like the ability to change the look of the watch screen.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,So far I'm not a fan.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch is very bulking and sits up high because it doesn't lay flat on the wrist.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Very uncomfortable.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've tried 3 different bands with it and none that make me want to wear it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've used it for one run/walk so far.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Endomondo measured it as 2.2 miles while the blaze measured only 1.7.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've used endomondo for a couple years and it's always been consistent.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Considering the watch is using the same GPS (the one in my phone) I was quite disappointed that it was so far off on the measurement.,"1,2,4",O,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,The battery life is good though.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Previously had the Fitbit Charge HR, and for a nominal upcharge (I paid $140 for this, and $130 for the Charge HR), this is a WAY better tracker.",5,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"A few of the things I liked best about this model: 1. the separation between the unit and the band - the reason I had to throw away my Charge HR was because the band separated from the unit, which made the whole thing useless, even though the electronic piece still worked fine.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"With the Blaze, a broken band can be easily replaced, and there are lots of 3rd party sellers out there so the bands are cheap 2. lots more functionality - different watch layouts, ability to choose exercise modes, call/text/email notifications, etc.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"3. you get a touchscreen interface The only feature this unit doesn't have that I want is true waterproofing - I wish I could swim with it and feel secure that it won't break, but I don't want to take that $140 risk.",1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Like with any heartrate trackers in this price range, some people will complain that the heartrate monitoring isn't super accurate, but I think those folks expect too much from a product in this price range.","1,3,4",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Last comment - unfortunately, my Blaze died after 6 months, but Fitbit's customer support was awesome, and made it super easy to request a replacement.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I supervise a team of 12, on a production line, interfacing with two upstream and one downstream departments.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I'm on my feet a lot.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Seeing the title and room location of meetings and the content of my text, without pulling out my phone and/or interrupting the conversation I having, has been immediately valuable.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I've long been a fan of the sleep tracking and heartrate monitoring offered by fitbit.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"For me, these have worked as perfectly on this device as on the Charge HR I've been wearing for about two years.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,One more great thing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I mentioned my Charge HR.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The app plays nice with both devices at once, allowing me to wear the charge during activities that would rather not be wearing the nicer Blaze, like climbing or really physical work, without losing any data.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Couldn't be happier!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This is better than the AppleWatch.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,So I wanted something to keep track of my steps.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I work at Amazon and we walk A LOT!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,but I was looking for something that could also receive text.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Since there are no phones allowed in the facility I wanted something where my husband could send a text if something was wrong at home.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Texting does not work unless your phone is nearby.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Great for exercise not for text, apps or anything else.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Pro's Nice screen Nice features Seemed relatively accurate.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Con's Disliked the side buttons which always paused my workout due to wearing gloves or wrist catching it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Just like the fitbit blaze, the wrist HR never seemed to keep up during High Intensity Workouts.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Seems wrist HR bands have ways to go yet.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"For these reasons, I returned this item.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have previously gone around with the surge and charge hr and while I liked them both ' I am enjoying the blaze even more.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It is lighter than the surge and you can almost forget that its on your hand.,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I always have my phone with me so I don't miss not having a gps on the watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The screen is ofcourse much more impressive and readable than the surge or charge and this watch can do many more actions than the limited screen on the charge you are able to pause the blaze during a run or walk which is something that cant be done on the charge.,"1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,what don't I like: 1.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It is very big and I don't especially like its shape 2. charging the watch is not easy and I am worried if the watch wont break with all the taking out and putting back in the body from its holder,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I really like this fitbit, it has a ton of band options, keeps me moving, notifies me of calls/text, and keeps me up to date with constant reminders of how out of shape I'm in (i.e.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,the fact that my heart rate goes into fat burning mode after walking up a flight of stairs).,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Unfortunately for me, after about a month of use I received a notification that I should update my fitbit.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I updated and it failed, however there was some sort of glitch and the screen wouldn't work.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,I will say fitbit customer service is excellent and they tried to walk me through everything to reset it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It ended up not working and they offered to replace.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I sent it in a couple weeks ago and should receive my replacement soon.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Bottom line, I would recommend this product.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,If something goes wrong they will make it right.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I wish the replacement process went a little faster but they are replacing it, so I really shouldn't complain.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I purchased two Fitbit Blaze's and I would have to give them a 3/5.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've tested the GPS (mile and step distance) and it would be inaccurate between two people walking together.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I would have 15,000 steps, while the person I'm walking with would have 8.000 steps.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,I'm 6'1'' and Person B is 5'6'' so you expect the shorter person to have more strides.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The distance is also inaccurate.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I've walked around a track which would be 1 mile, but it reports .65 miles.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,One of the main reasons I purchased this was to track my HR during workouts and it's been a hit or miss.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"After heavy deadlifts, where my heart is pounding, this would report my HR as 75...really?!!","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Not recommended...,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Bought last February.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Like the features but battery life is two days max.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Flip features works only sometimes have to push the button to get the time which is aggravating to say the least.,"1,2,6",O,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Steps about 15% inaccurate.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,HR monitor reasonably close to my chest monitor just lags in real time.,1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,2,"Bought in March 2017, it's September 2017 and completely broken.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It will not charge no matter what I do.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I was on the phone with fitbit customer service and they had me trying to reset & clean pins but nothing was happening.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,I never wear it near water.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This is the 2nd fitbit this year that has broke.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I will probably be switching to Garmin since nobody will help me to replace at this time.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Hands down one of the best fitness watches, I wanted something comparable to my wife's apple watch but as I haven't drunk the kool-aid and don't have an apple phone I went with this and to my surprise, it does things her watch can't, like control Spotify.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's easy to pop in and out of the band's sports one for working out and fashion one for the office.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It looks like a regular watch but does so much more.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The accessories won't break the bank so if you're like me and like different watch bands then you can have numerous ones.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love the Blaze - great purchase.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I like the Blaze over the Surge.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Surge was too masculine for my small wrist.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Blaze is a smaller frame than the Surge and works for everyday wear.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The colors are nice and bright.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I would recommend this to anyone wanting to have a 'smart' fitness watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have had a Fitbit Flex for a few years.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I finally decided to upgrade and am so happy that I did.This is a great upgrade.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,5,I also am walking more throughout the day with the reminders every hour during the work day to walk.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It does well tracking exercise as well and I use it in tandem with my Orange Theory heart rate monitor.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is built of tougher stuff then my flex and it has been charging so but better then the flex.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It last about 4 days for me on a charge.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I've owned several of the fitness watches over the years, and they've all had one thing in common.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The rubber on the band peels off from too much time outside in hot environments.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"This watch has a lot of functionality, great battery life, is relatively water resistant, and, most importantly, you can get several different watch bands to go with it.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,None of the other fitness bands that I've purchased managed to make it a year before I threw it in a drawer and got a new one.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"This one is on track to make it until the battery will no longer hold a charge, hopefully a long time from now.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I had the Fitbit HR before but it gave me a rash within 3 weeks of use, so I had to return it.","3,4",,,

B019VM3F2M,4,Will check in later to update the review.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Works, not sure how accurate.",2,,Inquiry,
B019VM3F2M,2,The Step count feature is as much as 40-50% off from my manual pedometer.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,That pedometer is off by 2-4% in itself.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Also I suffer from rapid heart beat on occasions.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This device does not pick up on that.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"While my heart rate on occasion goes to 130-150 beats per minute for ten to twenty minutes, the fit bit rarely goes higher that 70-90 at the same time.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"As for its measure of sleep time, it once credited me with and extra 4 hours of sleep when I wasn't wearing it.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,It seems more accurate when measuring flights of stairs climbed.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I give it an A for effort, D or F for execution.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It does give an idea of how active you are.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Having had both a fitbit flex in the past as well as an original Moto 360 smart watch; this hands down is the best of both worlds!,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I'm very impressed with the quality of the watch and the battery life (so far I'm getting about 3 days with heavy use and notifications).,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I was very surprised at how comfortable the stock band is; I didn't think I'd be able to sleep with it on, but it's actually not really noticeable.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The charger is a bit janky and it sucks you have to take the tracker out of the frame/band to charge it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Also the notification syncing for (atleast for Android) seems a bit wonky, they show up fine on the tracker, but don't sync when dismissed on one device or the other.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Another positive is that an aftermarket frame/band can really upgrade the look of your tracker.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Received an obviously used Fitbit even though paid full retail price for a new Fitbit.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The box had clearly been open before.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"In addition, when examining the main watch component, it was apparent that someone had been using the Fitbit prior to returning the merchandise.",7,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,There was a film of dirt on the back of the watch that indicated use.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Will be returning.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The fitbit blaze has worked well so far.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It is a very useful workout tool and is pretty accurate with the readings.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have cleaned the wristband each night after use and have not run into any rash problems.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The reason I gave it 4 stars was because there are only 4 different watch faces to choose from and the battery only lasts a few days.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Other than that, this was a good investment for the price.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I love my Fitbit Blaze and wear it everyday.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I am very disappointed that it only stays charged approx.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,30-40 hours per charge.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Most other people I know that wear them sy theirs stays charged for 4-5 days!,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I won't be recommending this to others because it's not very convenient to wear and I don't get very accurate account of my activity when I'm have to charge it so often.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Very disappointed for the money how unreliable my Blaze is.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Typical Fitbit hype.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,3,Screen is very dark.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Band is HORRIBLE!,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,You have to break it down to charge it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This is my 3rd and last Fitbit product.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"They consistently have terrible quality, although good.customer service hence the 2 stars.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I would rather have a good quality fitness tracker and not have to use the customer service.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I never thought I would want or like a fitness watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Finally gave in and now I am hooked.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,First it is nice watch where you can easily change bands and needs to be charged for a few hours every five days.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Synced to my iphone easily where I can monitor sleep patterns and much more.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It tracks heartbeat along with my movements or lack there of during the day.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,You can even get text messages or alerted to calls on you phone as long as you are within bluetooth range.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,There are many more functions.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,No way to tell durability but if it lasts 2 years - I will be satisfied.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Battery life is fair!,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have to charge this watch once every 2 days!,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,If i had to buy it again I would go with the fitbit charge 2.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Its no good if you can't use all the features and keep the battery life.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,You have to shut all of the features off to keep the battery life sufficient.,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,I don't use any of the extra features because I will have to charge it daily if I do.,"1,2,6",C,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Got my Fitbit Blaze and overall it is a good watch for the price.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Like the clarity and ease of dashboard...it is designed quite well.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,It will take a while to completely understand all the ins and out.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,At the onset it is fairly intuitive to get it going except was and is tough to understand what all the buttons do....no where is explained in the accompanying collateral.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Also, there is no watch face available that shows a seconds hand or value.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,I hope the company can come up with one.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I know it will make it more useful and open more doors for sales.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"My daughter who is in the medical profession, I think it is a must for her to have a watch that has a seconds count while she works.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"She liked the Blaze so much, wanted to buy another one, but did not for the lack of seconds hand on any of the watch faces.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It seems to be everything it says it is.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It does pair with an Apple 6 phone and it is used to record activity, heart rate, and sleep analysis.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,It is used to check incoming text messages and it can be recharged without difficulty.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The Blaze has a nice appearance and the case and strap can be changed.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Like most new electronic products, it does take time to learn how to use it.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Getting started can take some time but if you have had an electronic smart watch before it will be learned quickly.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Someone with no experience could require help to get started.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I gave this watch to my wife and not being computer smart, she has learned to enjoy the watch.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Excellent choice.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I purchased this for my 14 year old son for Christmas.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,He insisted on the Fitbit instead of the Apple Watch.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"For the most part he likes it, however, one of the charging ports on the charging cradle have pushed in and I am unable to get it to pop back out leaving us unable to use either the charger or the band because it is unable to be charged.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I can't even be sure how this happened as it's not really something that gets a lot of use (the charger).,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I'm on my 3rd fit bit (2surge and 1 blaze) Friend of mine is an EMT so I figured I'll check how accurate heart monitor was against a real heart monitor.. Well it was off by at least 10-20 bpm.,"1,4,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,So when it comes down to accuracy that's out the window so is pedometer if you're active e.g..,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Pushing a grocery count if your wrist is not moving your not getting your steps....(that's why I never win weekly step challenges against my friends :-P ) The 'quick view' feature on the blaze is worse than the one on the Surge bearly picks up my wrist motion to where I end up pressing the side button..really frustrating especially when you are in the middle of running and want a quick peek on your time.,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Battery life is much better than my Surge and I feel as it's less bulky.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I wish fit bit came out with more face display designes but I'm being picky at this point.,1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you want it as nothing else as a watch then it's not a bad purchase, being that it's cheaper than the surge and has a color screen blaze is no brainer.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I like how I can customize bands by 3rd party companies.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"The watch does what it is supposed to do, but is just so large.","1,2","P,C",Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I wanted to give it to my husband as it just doesn't look right on my small wrist, but he doesn't like it either as it is so large.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"As someone who was teetering between getting an Apple Watch and the Blaze, I'm very glad I decided to get this...So far I'm really enjoy it and it has all the fitness options I want without feeling like I'm connected to my cell phone all the time.","2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The charge indeed DOES last about 5 days which I though was impressive and true to what the box said about it.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I've gotten many comments on the sleekness of it, and personally I don't think it's any more bulky than a normal watch.","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Eventually I'll get a more casual band but I love the black one!,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Great product and I recommend it for anyone who's extremely active or looking for a nice fitness watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,i think the fitbit blaze is great!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"love it so much more than my apple watch, as i didn't use any of the apps for it.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"hopefully they start integrating some kind of apps though, like My Fitness Pal or something for reminders to log food!",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,5,FitBit UI has always been my favorite UI out of all of the other fitness trackers.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love that it can be used across devices (android/iOS) instead of 'galaxy gear' or an 'apple watch' which are only compatible with their own OS.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,So I got the Fitbit as a gift for myself...,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I wanted something to track my steps and heart rate..,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,However the blaze is far from accurate...,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I had the blaze on the charger over night and when I woke up it told me I had walked 600 steps and burned 300 cAlories meanwhile it never moved..,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"When I do wear it, it makes a little square indent from the battery in the back... Also I found my fingers tingling and pain in my wrist...",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I took it off and took about 6 hours for the tingling to go away...,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Sadly nothing on this blaze is accurate,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I am a small woman and this watch is really large for me.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Be aware it does not have GPS unless you have your phone with you so this didn't really fit what I needed.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Also, it's so big that I cannot sleep with it on.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you have a larger wrist and don't need GPS, this would probably be perfect for you!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I'm using an Android 5.2.1 device with this product which may impact whether you like it or not.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"iOS may handle this device better, but unfortunately for my needs this just wasn't sufficient.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The first problem I noticed was the inability to reject calls.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,They have reserved this functionality for iOS.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"This in itself wasn't a deal breaker, but a bummer.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The second problem that did break this for me was text notifications not displaying properly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"If you use any text application beyond the stock one you will get issues, for example if you don't dismiss your texts religiously after receiving them you'll get 'X unread messages' where X is the number not yet read.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Since I use my phone as a pager via text messages, I need to be able to glance at my watch regularly to gauge priority without necessarily reading the full text.",6,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Combined with how Fitbit has generally blamed the carrier, the app, and the OS it's clear to me they will not be supporting this product nearly enough to justify the cost.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Others can utilize these functions fine, likely via Android Wear acceptable APIs.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,The fact that they chose this path screams of lazy development.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I must say that this watch is pretty slick.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Not a lot of extras but everything you need in a fitness tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I own a gym and am recommending our clients purchase fit bit products.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is the extra step involved in getting to some of the info.,2,,Problem Discovery,(good exmaple of Complaint)
B019VM3F2M,4,"for example, depending on the screen, you will have to tap a couple of times to see your heart rate, when you are not exercising.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Overall, great product and worth buying.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I would recommend this to anyone interested in keeping track of daily stats and real time exercise stats.,"3,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"First time setup completed with seemingly no issues, however since then I have had near constant sync/Bluetooth issues and have never actually gotten notifications to work.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"From other reviews on Amazon and Fitbit, it seems these issues were common on my Samsung Galaxy s8 because until recently it was not an officially compatible devices.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"However it has been officially announced compatible as of July, but these issues remain common.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Device and Fitbit resets and restarts do not help.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I will be returning this device for a different model and giving Fitbit a second chance, as I have liked previous Fitbit and their community/app features are the best in my opinion.","2,4",,Information Giving,or Human Usability
B019VM3F2M,2,Hopefully a different model will actually be compatible as they say this should be.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Pros: Design, decent price for a smart watch looking fitness tracker, Fitbit app and community systems, nice acreen Cons: frequent sync delays, Bluetooth unpairing, repairing and setup hit or miss","1,2","P,C",Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love this tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's helped me lose 15 lbs by keeping track of how many calories I burn per day and eating 500 less than that.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I used to have the charge HR, I love this one so much more, I love the music control, the workout tracking function, the sleep tracking function, and the ability to track my runs, as well as instant heart rate monitor.","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Lots of great features.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The tracker seems to work well however the app and customer support are pitiful.,"1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,can't get the verification email after many attempts and can't remove the annoying banner.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Took too many attempts to sync to iPod and customer support advised me to return the product to amazon.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Will wait it out and hopefully be able to write a better review,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"With how big this is it took a bit of getting used to wearing it, but I have worn it daily since buying it almost 5 months ago.","1,4",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I have the app on my android phone and my tablet, and I have logged in to my account on my PC as well.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The app allows me to track a lot of different things, more than I actually use in fact.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Maybe some day I will get to the point of using all of the features.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It holds a charge well, I only recharge it once a week.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It does not have to update often thankfully.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The 5-10 minute update process took over 90 minutes to complete last week, and it was that long actually out of the box when I set it up too, but I have had zero problems with it since purchase.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"This is the only fitness tracker I have owned, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say I am happy with this purchase.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"A lower price would have been great of course, but it's been worth it so far.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I really want to love my Fitbit Blaze, but it's hard to.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I love that I can read my text messages and see who is calling through the screen.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,I love that I can select exercises and just do it with the watch.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"However, I hate that the mile and step count is not accurate.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I have completed multiple 5K's where the step count is only around 4,000 steps and the mileage says 1.5 miles.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"With my Fitbit Charge, my mileage was always accurate and my steps were on point.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I really hope this is something that can be fixed in the near future because I really want to love it, and I don't.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This is my first fitness watch and I have to say I love it!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Being able to track my activity is really fun and seeing my sleep and heart rate is a great plus.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The ability to link up with myfitnesspal pushes this product over the top!,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,UPDATE: I've now owned this watch for a little over a year and have to say its proven to be a bit mediocre.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"My biggest complaints have to be the issue with syncing that sometimes occur, the shorter battery life as time passes, and the fact that the band broke completely in just a years time.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,With a price tag of $200 I assumed this product would be a lot more reliable.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"While it does what it says it does, it does not stand the test of time.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I love the watch itself, mainly because the heart monitor is almost dead on compared to other heartmonitors, however it is severely limiting in hooking up with most new phones.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I had a Volt and it worked great with it, but the Volt is fairly old and mine died.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Fun times.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"So I was looking to get a new one, and almost all new phones outside of the iphones didn't work with it.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I could get some to connect to it with 'classic' mode, but it wouldn't actually DO anything (not even teh music like it's supposed to) really unhappy with it.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Returning it for a much cheaper smart watch that will actually work with phones instead of this one.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Not worth $200, but it IS a good watch if it actually connects to your phone.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I really enjoyed being able to switch bands, and bought a few (damn me for wanting to look fashionable)","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"A lot of my family members have fitbits of some kind, so I decided to join in.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I couldn't be more satisfied with Blaze.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's intuitive and easy to use, and has a ton of great features.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The watch automatically tracks steps, distance, calories burned, floors climbed, heart rate, and has the capability to do even more beyond that.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It can track sleep cycles, when you wake up in the middle of the night, when you wake up in the morning, and even calculate 30-day averages for sleep stages and total time spent asleep.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You can also use the watch as a fitness tracker - running, walking, aerobic exercise, you name it and the Blaze can track it - except swimming.",1,"P,C",,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Though water resistant, it is not water proof, and that is one of only two downsides, the other being the lack of GPS tracking without connection to a phone.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The watch wears comfortably, the strap is fairly easy to adjust, and I don't really have any complaints about it.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You can also choose from a number of different interfaces on the watch screen, so you can make it appeal to your own personal taste.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I definitely would recommend the Fitbit Blaze to anyone looking to go above and beyond with tracking daily activity.,"3,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Not worth the money, until fitbit fixes the bugs.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Its great for the first 45 days..suddenly when you're outside of the return window, the watch takes a crap!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Its doesn't stay paired, the bluetooth consistently turns off on its own, you have to reboot the watch for the bluetooth option to reappear.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Forget about using its running feature, 9 times out of 10, it will tell you it cannot find your phone!",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,I have a Samsung S6- which their website states is a compatible device......,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've received one replacement and its just as crappy the second time around!,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,1,I have enjoyed my Fitbit blaze but after 6 months the back of the blaze (the pebble not the band ) is giving me a rash,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love the new blaze so far.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Please know I am writing this within hours of using it, so I might update this review.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I bought the surge in December 2014 and absolutely loved it and haven't gone a day without it, but I hated the bulky design and how the band would smell after high intensity cardio even with regular washing.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The biggest thing I'm excited about is the interchangeable bands, especially when they start to stink.","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I'm not a runner or hiker so the GPS thing doesn't bother me at all.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I do Insanity and Insanity max30, and this thing is pretty darn close with heart rate compared to chest strap monitors (also, virtually identical stats between the surge and the blaze, as I wore them both today during my workout).","1,4,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The new design is incredibly sleek and the photos do NOT do this product justice.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It looks a lot bigger in photos than it does on your wrist, especially compared to the surge.","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's smaller, better looking and has all the things you look for from Fitbit.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Highly recommended :) (this is a size small and has significantly longer straps than the surge small size, and I don't have extra tiny wrists, so IOW, the blaze small is more like a surge large).",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Got my fitbit and had it all set up then tried to connect it to my phone to use the music features.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Out of three different phones mine is the one that wouldn't work.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It says ASUS isn't on their list of supported phones but an older ASUS phone connected fine just like my mother in laws IPhone did.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,Guess I'll be sending it back and looking for a different device.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I absolutely love the Surge along with the band style/size and the color.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I did upgrade and this seems to suit my wants/needs better than my previous Fitbit.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The previous two bands had separated/pulled away at the screen.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I  submitted my first under the warranty...then the replacement gave me issues as well.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,This band isnt connected in the same way.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I feel it was due to my wrist being in between the small and large only size options.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,ONE downside to this band is that I'm getting color transfer from my clothing and/or keyboard so it's starting to look dingy.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I will be purchasing some off market bands to replace it!,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Pros: 1) It has a touchscreen 2) more workout features than the previous Fitbit 3) The wristband is interchangeable Cons: 1) the touchscreen sometimes freezes and you have to wait a few seconds for it to start working again.,"1,5","P,C",,
B019VM3F2M,4,The touchscreen is not as responsive as an iPhone or most Androids.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,2) the altimeter sensor needs to be recalibrated as it does not accurately calculate my stair climbing.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Many times I walk upstairs to the 2nd floor in my house and it does not input the data.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have a flight of 16 stairs.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"3) not water resistant (but the new model is at a much higher price) 4) after using this for a year, I can say that the battery life lasts up to 3.5 days on a single charge if you are actively using this device every day.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"If you hardly touch this device while wearing it, it can last up to 5.5 days on a single charge.",1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I just got my Fitbit Blaze and right away there are few things I believe are more of a nuisance and can be looked into to make it more effective for its users.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"First, there is nothing that tells you what needs to be done and I am not a psychic to know looking at a watch that says fitbit.com/setup under an arrow that I need to go online to that web address.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,A note or a small card containing step by step directions would be really helpful for users who aren't into tech stuff.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I like the interface and how easy it was to sync it up to an online account once established.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Again, would be nice if I was told I had to open an account.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It's pretty neat once you get through minor hiccups initially.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I wouldn't mind just a tad bit bigger screen and a better touch experience.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,However this gets the job done.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"So overall, it justifies the price, expected quirks, and room to improve.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Definitely worth it when compare to Apple Watch,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch worked great at the beginning didn't have any problems with anything.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,But in couple of months it's stoped syncing with my phone.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,So every time when I try to resync it I have to delet my device from apps memory or even reinstall the actual app.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,On top of everything I started to get rush and skin irritation from the band even tho I don't have any sort of allergies.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,But during that short time when watch works and I don't have any skin problems I actually really like it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Product no longer works , do we have any kind of manufacturing warranty ?",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Does not keep good charge , also erases all mememory each days .",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,At first I really liked the Blaze but it didn't take long for me to suspect that the steps were off.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I measured both the steps and the mileage against other devises and route markers.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The results varied in how far off the tracker was but each time it came in under.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Even running the same test multiple times the difference could vary by as much as 500-800 steps.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Unfortunately, due to external circumstances, I was unable to return the Blaze within the Amazon return window.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I tried calling Fitbit directly but the would not stand behind the product to allow me to return it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This is my third Fitbit purchase but it will be my last.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"After having my FitBit Blaze for a few days, I LOVE IT.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is way better than my FitBit Charge that I loved.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The screen is smooth with the touch screen, it snaps in and out easily enough, but its strong enough to hold it.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It fits great, looks great, isnt too big, and is SOOOO easy to use.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The connection to my phone is flawless and replacing the band for other colors is easy as well.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The notifications on it are definitely a huge plus.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You can read texts, see calls and answer them, see calendar things and more!",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The its great for working out as well.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The battery is pretty decent, only needing charged every 4 or 5 days.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,My only suggestion or wish is that you can get to the timing feature either quicker or you can just hold down one of the side buttons to start a timer.,1,"C,R",,
B019VM3F2M,5,I highly recommend!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I've had this Fitbit now for at least 6 months.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I really like it, but the one thing that drives me crazy is that it's hit or miss when you go to sync it to your phone.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It will sync fine, then for some reason it won't sync no matter what you do.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,I usually have to delete the watch and add it new to trick the phone into thinking it's new...and this usually works.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,5,I was on the fence for months about either getting a FitBit Blaze or an Apple Watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"After many reviews, I chose the FitBit Blaze because of all the fitness and health options it offers that the Apple Watch didn't.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I also didn't need all the features that the Apple Watch provided.,"4,5",,,

B019VM3F2M,5,The battery life is awesome as well.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have yet to have it die on me - I've worn it for 48 hours and the battery has never gone below 'medium.',1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"With the app, it also syncs easily with My Fitness Pal.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I definitely recommend the Blaze to anyone who is really into fitness and doesn't need all of the other notifications and functions that the Apple Watch provides.,"2,3,5",,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,2,Amazon did their best to help me and for that I am grateful but after talking to Fitbit they told me I wasn't getting accurate information because it worked off GPS and I needed to work out doors but I work out inside a gym and the walls block the GPS,"1,7",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I do like this Fitbit Blaze, but the battery has started draining within 6 hours after every charge.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I don't think I can return it at this late date, but is there a way to have the battery replaced?","1,4",I,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"This FitBit is pretty handy, though it doesn't notify me of any messages or calls even after I've set it up to do so.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,It does pretty good with tracking my activity and I like the feature that will take you through a workout that you choose on the Fitstar app.,"1,5",P,,

B019VM3F2M,4,4 days to 1 day.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I contacted support via e-mail and they told me to do the things posted on their website about not properly charging even though it was clear to me the most likely cause was a faulty battery/short between the cells.,"1,3",C,,

B019VM3F2M,4,However the wristband started reacting with my sweaty skin and leaving itchy bumps.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I had to replace the wristband; a small price to pay to keep using my FitBit.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I purchased my Blaze here on Amazon in November 2016, and I've been using it daily since then.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I upgraded from a Fitbit Charge HR, and after using the Blaze for awhile, I think I could have saved my money and kept the Charge.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Don't get me wrong, the Blaze is cool tech, but the reason I upgraded was really to be able to get email and text notifications on the Blaze.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"It does provide that option, but it's really more annoying than useful.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I can read texts on the screen, while email notifications are just the sender and subject, which is fine.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Call notifications are helpful too, but a lot of the time when I get a call notification, my Blaze doesn't start buzzing until the call has already gone to voice mail and by then I've missed it.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"But, my biggest disappointment is that the text/email notification option is pretty much useless because the Blaze doesn't differentiate between new notifications and ones it's already given me.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"So, I get some notifications and acknowledge them by either swiping them away or pressing 'Clear All,' but then when I get new notifications, all of the ones I already acknowledged come back too, so this feature isn't very useful.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"You can also control music on your phone (start, pause and stop play), and I use that occasionally.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I love the styling of the Blaze and it looks good on, but because it was pretty expensive compared to the Charge HR, I am almost hesitant to use it while exercising because it gets sweaty and dirty!","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Overall, I like it, but for what I can use it for, I could have kept my Charge HR.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I am amending my review and taking away one star, because four months later, my heart rate is suddenly being read at no higher than 89 bpm, which is know is absolutely inaccurate because of several reasons:  I can feel my actual heart beat pounding rapidly, two other devices showed me a HR of 140+, it's friggin Leg Day and nothing gets my heart pumping like Leg Day, so there's absolutely no way in heck my pulse is only 84 bpm.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Don't get me started on the Customer Service for Fitbit...least helpful I've ever had.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I cannot understand why Fitbit sends out rather expensive watches with no charge in the battery and no instructions on how to set it up or even how to charge it in the first place.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have gone through several Fitbits and the rechargeable batteries never last more that 12-18 months.,1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,4,So this was a gift for my mom for Mother's Day.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"And while, I am pretty decently versed in many different technological devices, setting up the Blaze was initially very challenging without actual directions being provided in the box.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I had to look online to figure out how to set it up.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"This was particularly necessary because for whatever reason, setting up on my mom's iMac just was not working.","3,4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"For some reason, the iMac did not recognize whether the Blaze's Bluetooth was turned on and the Blaze was not helpful because it kept saying log into the fitbit website for set up.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"*For the record, I knew the iMac's Bluetooth was in working order because both the keyboard and the mouse are wireless and I was actively using them.",5,,,

B019VM3F2M,4,"While the Blaze does not have all the snazzy effects of the iWatch, it does have some of the same things as the iWatch, most notably, the Blaze will notify you when you have phone calls (even when your phone is on silent).","2,5",,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,4,"My mom is definitely enjoying wearing it and being more aware of her day-to-day health and activity level, but she (i.e.","3,4",,,

B019VM3F2M,4,Update: customer service through chat and they are replacing both devices.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,3,The only reason I did not give it 4 stars instead of 3 is that I purchased the Blaze specifically because the clock face is large and easy to read.,"1,4",P,,

B019VM3F2M,4,Pros: battery - lasts ~5 days on a charge and recharges quickly; watch-based HR and sleep monitors are helpful tools in tracking overall fitness (although I'm not convinced they're particularly accurate); easy to use and understand online 'dashboard' (activity log).,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Cons: main con is a big one for me...instead of just raising/moving the watch--or even tapping the screen--and having the face wake up, I generally (90% of the time) have to push a button just to see what time it is, how much time has elapsed in my workout, or how much time I have left; generic 'workout' tracking is questionable - I have to laugh when I mow the yard and am credited with a 45 minute 'outdoor cycling' workout.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,2,I start by saying I like the device a lot.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The reason for the 2 star is early battery failure.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've had the device for 19 months and it will only hold a charge for about 6 hours.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,At the price I paid that amounts to over $11/mo cost average to use the device.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"After some negotiating, Fitbit is sending me a new device as a replacement.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"If that device also lasts the same amount of time, that will average out to over $5.50 per month.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I hope this one holds longer but, if it doesn't, I'll be looking for a different device.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"BTW, the device did drop down to the 6 hour discharge window in a couple of days, but I did notice a slow progression over the last 6-8 months where it was requiring charging more and more often.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"New, it lasted over a week, a few weeks ago it was down to 3-4 days, and now it's 6 hours.",1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,3,"worthless will not sync with Windows 10,  Imac you need the blaze plugged into the charger and usb plugged into the imac and it took along time to figure that out given the poor tech support.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I've never been so frustrated with a device or the lack of costumer service.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"you have to use the charging pod to sync with the mac, got this for my dad and he doesn't have a Smart Phone and doesn't want one but wants to track his exercise and sleeping, so I'll have to see what he thinks about it over time.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like the design and look and hope it works out well for him fortunately he just got a Ipad air 2 which will sync wireless via the blue tooth,  but the initial set up had to be done on the Imac could not even get the pc software to download from the windows store!","1,2,4,6",P,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,4,I like this base because it seems preferable than unclicking the Blaze Watch face every time to close in charging cord.. better to just place it on a base then just pop it off an continue wearing when done charging.,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"This does everything the other FitBits do and more;  It has the few features I would want from the much more expensive iWatch (text alerts,music control, event reminders, call alert and control, silent alarms) and the display is very clear and legible.","1,2",P,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,5,"My only complaint is their proprietary charging cradle; I have to think they could fit a micro-usb charging port on the watch so you could charge on the go with  a generic cable, but instead you have this clunky cradle that is too big to carry around with you and, if you are traveling, pretty impossible to find as an accessory in an electronics store.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Fortunately, there are after market suppliers on Amazon that you can order them from, which I highly recommend, both as a backup and/or to have someplace at your job, so you can charge it during downtime, as between using it to track activity AND sleep, you need to find the downtime to charge it.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I'm also not a big fan of the silicone band (talk about a sweaty wrist), but again, there are a ton of aftermarket band options out there for reasonable prices.",1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,4,I would recommend getting a second setup of frame+bands for this though.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,And I don't know what I would've done without a screen protector - my wrist is constantly on the concrete or slapping against something when I work out- I have no idea how the rest of you manage to keep your unprotected fitbits from just exploding during a session =P,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,SAMSUNG S8 AND S8+ USERS.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Do not buy this, it won't work correctly, there is currently no support for your phone.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Notifications won't work and your workouts won't track properly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,I'd advise buying another watch or waiting till it supports the S8 line.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I received this in October and by February it stopped functioning properly.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The display no longer activated with wrist movement and the step timer would stop and start.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Bugs need to be worked out of this design.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I bought the Fitbit blaze on the reco on a friend who had the other Fitbit watch with the electrics integrated into the band, which he had to replace once or twice due to the band cracking over time.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The blaze has not disappointed one bit.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It tracks steps, syncs easily with my phone,, the only issue I have, and it is a small one, is that when I hold the handrails on the treadmill, it does not track my steps as well, c'est la vie.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The band is great, it holds a charge for roughly 5 days.","1,3",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I did forget my charger while traveling, and an aftermarket charger was available on Amazon and it shipped quickly enough to arrive before my battery went dead.","4,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,This has been a great addition to my workout regimen.,"3,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Seems to be more accurate than the other cheaper Fitbit Products.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,You can't just shake your hands or wrist to get the steps.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"If you don't really care for the looks especially the watchfaces, I'd recommend the Alta HR or Charge 2 as you get the same technical stuff for the cheaper price.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The extra $50 (compared to the Charge 2) on the long run didn't really feel like a good value.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Music control and Notification didn't seem to be all that great especially if it doesn't want to work.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,The customization of the looks was bleak and the 'watch' look got old.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Using the blaze with galaxy s6 edge.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It works great after you learn how to use it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Two issues I have with it is it tends to respond rather slow sometimes.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,The other issue is the audio control sometime works.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I found that disconnecting it from Bluetooth and reconnecting it would resolve the issue.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"FYI: text and call notification works fine on my phone but a friend using a nexus told me the notification does not always work and when making a phone call, the blaze will show that he is receiving a call from the person he is trying to call.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,The best product I have purchased all year.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I absolutely love this watch/ fitness tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The app that runs with the blaze is really easy to use.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love how it keeps up with all the stats for you on the app and watch.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love everything about this watch coming from someone that is trying to get back in shape.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This is one tool I would recommend for anyone that is active and trying to get the best edge in training they can get.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Not to mention this watch just looks great and wears just as good,  I would also like to mention the step counter and heart rate monitor are on point.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Unlike most step counter where you just move your arms and it counts as a step this one will only count actually steps.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The heart rate is dead on as I have compared this to some of the heart rate machines that my facility nurses use in their work.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Again great product and if you got the money to purchase one I highly recommend it since this will be one the best items you buy if you use it properly.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It does everything you expect from a Fitbit.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"For the price, however, Fitbit will have to start thinking about waterproofing.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The competition is really starting to give Fitbit a run for the money.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Compared to the Garmin 230 and the Withing, which looks even more like a watch, this product leaves somewhat to be desired.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"However, Fitbit has a better online community for challenges with friends and family.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"If you don't care about that though, then check out some of the other options.",8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I'm loving this product so far.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It has really motivated me to get up off my butt and move.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I'm losing weight again and hopefully, this time will hit my target goal and keep myself in a healthy range.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The heart rate monitor did stop working at one point but a reboot of the watch easily fixed that.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Update: 1/3/17 The watch is now slowly dying and not holding a full charge.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The screen is doing some weird lines across the display periodically.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I don't feel like this Fitbit was built as sturdy as some of the other models out there.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It's ok but has some irritating quirks.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The heartbeat is not accurate, especially during workouts (I'm 55, it regularly shows my rate at peak 160 plus rates for 1-2 hours).",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The count for going up stairs and up hills is very inaccurate, unlike my Fitbit One which died after 18 months which was very accurate.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Another irritant is the delay to wake up when I turn my wrist towards me to see what time it is.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,The battery does not last nearly as long as promised if you use it to track exercise.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Finally, you're supposed to be able to tap it twice to wake it up - seldom works.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I can live with all of these for now, but I doubt I'll get a new one when this one dies or recommend it to anyone unless they can fix these pt.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I absolutely love this fitbit!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is heads and tails above the flex in terms of features and functions.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It really is just like the Apple Watch (as my husband has the Apple Watch) BUT it is a fraction of the cost.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Unfortunately, I lost it within the first three weeks of owning it!",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was heartbroken and very upset with myself for losing it!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,My husband suggested I call Amazon to see if they have a buyer protection program.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I never thought in a million years they would replace the fitbit at no cost, but low and behold, they did!","4,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Amazon, you ROCK!",7,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Purchased this as a mother's day gift for a fitbit snob.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,She hated it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Was not accurate at all.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"After a week of use, she was completely jealous of my Samsung Gear 3.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I got tired of her saying mine doesn't do that.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"She is an iphone user, so I sent this back for the apple watch.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,She is now in heaven.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"It was a nice try Fitbit, but definitely a swing and a miss.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,One of the best presents I have ever gotten.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love this thing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It never leaves my wrist (unless showering).,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have lost 8 lbs in 4 weeks just walking and keeping track with this device.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's like a personal cheerleader that is always with you.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This doesn't properly track flights of stairs.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Flights must be 10' or greater to count, you cannot be holding the hand rail, you cannot be carrying something that restricts the movement of your arm.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I found the step tracker in general to be not very accurate.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"If you're walking across a parking lot, it is fine, but if you're trying to squeeze in some last minute steps to meet your goal by stepping in place, it doesn't track them at all.","1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I thought these features were pretty basic, and this Blaze was too expensive to get this wrong.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,There are much cheaper alternatives that do just as well or better.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I was interested in this for the heart rate monitoring, which seemed accurate to me when I checked my pulse myself.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It provides a nice analysis of the heart rate.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"It was nice to get text notifications on the watch, but it also allows you to answer an incoming phone call on the watch, which is weird because then you have to go find your phone while the other party is waiting.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was looking for a replacement for the Surge because it gave me a rash due to the metal screws making contact with my skin.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It sucks to be allergic to certain metals, and this was a good option.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I had considered an Apple Watch, but I am glad I got this instead.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I don't need to respond to anyone with my watch, I don't care to play with too many apps; I just wanted a device with some music control when I work out.","2,4",,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4,"good watch, after walking for a while I noticed it made my wrist sweat, but that's to be expected.","1,3",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"charging is decent, syncing is lame though, its slow, and when doing it manually it almost refuses to about 70% of the time.","1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love.... my blaze.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have had 3 other Fitbits other than this one.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This one is much better because of the chattering aspect of it.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The other ones I have to charger u stick into the back of them; well the piece holding the charger in always broke on me.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This blaze charges differently and is way better.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,All u do is pop the screen out of the watch band and stick it in the lil charging box that it comes with.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This one should last me much longer and has tons of options for bands to get for it.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Fitbit technology etc is good as noted by others and the reason I bought one after my Fitibit Surge band broke prematurely (and which could not be replaced :(  )  But the time and effort to recharge the watch is really not acceptable.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Was no design option available that did not require a user to basically dismantle and reconstruct the watch every 5 days?,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The little clasps to lock and unlock the bands from the watch face holder is an absolute pain for people who are not highly dexterous.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This Fitbit has changed my life.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Goals are more easily accomplished with accountability, and this little gadget keeps me accountable to myself.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I walk more and exercise more.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I've lost 16 pounds since using it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's keeping me on track, and I love it.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I intend to use it for a very long time.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"It is really nice, but the band irritated my skin no matter how many times I cleaned it.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I ended up giving it to a friend because my wrist was too sensitive.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Nice watch overall but it needs to be charged every 2 days which is very annoying.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I just wanted it because the face was big and I wanted to count steps.....,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I am amazed at how much more comfortable this is too wear vs the Charge HR.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is bigger but not as tall and feels like a snug fitting watch.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,If you are on the fence and thinking about purchasing one DO NOT WAIT!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love the large color screen and how easy it is to set up.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I had the Blaze up and running in 5 minutes.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Only negatives which I knew before buying is it is not waterproof and the charger appears to be an afterthought.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is not hard to charge but just seems so unintuitive.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,A magnetic charger like the Apple Watch would have been the better approach.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,BTW I also have an Apple Watch that I gave to my son.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Fitbit is a much better fitness device than the Apple Watch and that is from someone who loves Apple products.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I enjoy the phone itself, my only issue is that it's advertised for a longer battery life-i think I read somewhere that you can go 5 days without charging.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Mine is not the case, I have to charge it every other day which is super annoying.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,My charge HR 2 went longer until I needed to charge it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Maybe it's because I bought it directly from the website and the blaze I bought through Amazon, so for those looking to buy it through Amazon, if recommend just purchasing it through the fitbit website because they seen to give out the better quality items for the same price.","3,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"the product itself is great, however i havent even had mine for a year and it needs replaced.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,i take very good care of it and everything.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,after the replacement dies i am not wasting 100+ dollars on anymore of these fitness trackers.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,at least this one lasted longer than my jawbone up2 and the replacement to that COMBINED(9 months),5,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,this is my second fitbit blaze.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I loved the first one.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"it lasted forever, easily 4-5 days even with wearing at night.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I lost it at the beach one day.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"So I bought a new one, and it must be faulty.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I can barely get two days off a full charge.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Not a major issue, but if I go out of town for a weekend, now I have to worry about bringing the charger and it's a pain in the butt.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I have it set on minimal battery consumption settings, it doesn't auto sync, the screen is dimmed, and I dont use the bluetooth for music/notifications... pretty disappointing battery life but otherwise it's great","1,2,3,6",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,There are a lot of good reviews on this fit bit.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I am upgrading from a flex and my blaze arrives tomorrow.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have seen complaints of people concerned and annoyed about having to pop it out of the band to charge it.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,There is a charger that clips around the device while in the band.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It runs between 7.00 and 13.00 on amazon.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"A gift for my son, he absolutely loves it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's nice looking, functional as a watch, and notifies him who is calling or texting so he doesn't have to look at his phone.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Having a sedentary job, he also likes that it reminds him to move, even if it is just to stand and stretch.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Fitbit app keeps all his stats and is easy to use.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,He said he also finds himself taking flights of stairs to see his heart rate increase.,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"If it gets him to move more, I say mission accomplished.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Would not recommend until fitbit irons out all the problems.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Main issue seems to be the battery.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It last about half the time as advertised.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Hence, your recharging every two days.","1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,My blaze actually reached the point where it could not be recharged at all.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This was within the first six months of ownership.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Now Fit bit did send me a replacement promptly but this only indicates they were aware of the Blaze battery issue.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Personally, they rushed production in order to hit the retail sector.",8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Nice watch but again it suffers badly with the battery.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Not recommended at this time.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I had a Fitbit Surge prior to this, but unfortunately the design of the wristband was poor and it broke.",5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Because I did like the Fitbit tech / ecosystem I decided to get this as a replacement.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"That said, before receiving this I thought I was really going to miss the GPS, but as it turns out I am not missing it at all!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It works in concert with my phone app to provide the same GPS data I was getting directly from my watch before.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Since I am always using my phone to play music on runs and workouts I am not missing anything.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The screen is much much better than what was on the Surge, and the design of the replaceable band is great.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Now I don't have to worry about getting a whole new device if the band broke.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"If I had to say anything negative about it, I'd say I would like more options for the home screen.",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,5,"There really wasn't any one of them I 'loved', so I settled and since have gotten used to it.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It would be fantastic if they added an option to customize it as well.. Now, if Fitbit could only design something I could swim with...","1,2",R,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,5,I own roughly 15 watches and this is my go to watch!!,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's looks great for my work as a healthcare professional and is good against sweat on a long run.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Steps and heart rate are great features as the seven minute workout is a great way to start working out.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Plus, when you get a text or call it vibrates your watch so you don't have to pull your phone right out.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Great for casual & sport uses!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,A great smart watch,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,VERY DISAPPOINTED.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I was hoping for a great fitness band that would be similar to the Apple watch but for my android.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've been SO frustrated with just trying to keep it paired.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I printed the manual and went through everything step by step to make sure I wasn't missing anything.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I thought I finally had it working, which I did... For a couple of days.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,That has been the longest I have been able to have the info feed tho the  app where it's useful.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I don't know if I have a faulty device, but I'm sorry I purchased it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"This watch combined with the app helps me make more health conscious decisions, along with keeping track of my progress.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I regret it taking me this long to get it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It has a decent battery life, allows you to change your music or adjust the volume, and you can link text or messenger notifications to it.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Works just as I expected it to, from telling me my steps and heart rate, right down to giving me notifications from Twitter, PSN and text messages.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,There are two things that are annoying and less of a deal breaker if you're currently on the fence on getting a Blaze.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"One, the wrist band is nice but it can be a bit of a pain in the butt when you want to take off your watch.",1,"P,C",,
B019VM3F2M,5,The reason for that is the notches in the band (think of a belt).,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"it'll stay secure on your wrist, but when you want to take it off you'll struggle a bit your first few times.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The second minor annoyance is having to re-enable notifications to sync up with your phone.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I occasionally find that notifications won't come to my Blaze even though they're enabled which would require me to go into the app, select notifications, turn off notifications and then turn them back on.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Other than that this is a neat fitness watch that fulfills my needs.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Had nothing but problems with the watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Texts do not come through as they should - get maybe 1 of every 3 texts.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Also, sends repeated texts.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I get one text on my phone, but it shows up 3 or 4 times on the watch which drains the battery.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I also reiceved a phone call that I sent to vm on my phone, however the watch shows the phone is still ringing when it is not.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Visually it is so cute and I really liked it - but the way it works is dissapointing.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Requesting a refund today and sending it back.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"My 2nd fit bit in the last few years, Ist one band fell apart and they would not replace the unit with out jumping though hoops to get it done.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Would not simply exchange the product.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"Now my blaze will no stay sync'd with my phone, even after trying to sync manually, it will not connect and say connected.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,Looked at my watch today and it is telling me the wrong time.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,Looked at my phone and it has not sync'd in over two weeks and still cannot manually connect it.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,"Find another product, especially at the $180.00 price tag they are asking for.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I will preface this by saying I am returning the Fitbit Blaze but not due to any problems!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I've had the Fitbit one for 3 years now and finally decided I deserved an upgrade!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I wanted one that would double up as a watch and get notifications from my phone so the blaze seemed like the perfect fit.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have M/L wrists so I thought it would be fine.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The reason I decided to return it was it's just a little too big for my taste so I'm going to go with the Charge HR2.,"1,4,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"With all of that being said, the blaze itself is awesome!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love getting the notifications from my phone so I feel like I can walk away for it for long periods of time but not miss anything important.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I really love that it also measures your heart rate and you can adjust your settings to whatever workout you are doing.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,If you don't mind a really big watch then this is a great choice!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Ordered this for my husband because I love mine so much.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I also ordered the Weight Guru scale to sync with our Fitbit app.,"2,5",,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,3,Updated: I finally got in touch with a customer support person.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Review went from 1 star to 3 stars only because they went out of their way to make things right and offered a one time out of warranty replacement.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This does not change the track record of unreliability for Fitbit trackers.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Original review: ?So sad!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,In true fassion my #fitbit blaze broke just over the year warranty.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I put this thing through a lot and thought I finally got a good Fitbit.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"But just like always, Fitbit I have last just over a year before something goes wrong.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This time the screen cracked.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Really!?,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,$200 watch worthless.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Contacted @fitbit @FitbitSupport #noresponse ?if you are going to by a Fitbit plan on getting a new one every 13 months or so.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Purchased as a requested Christmas Gift and while the family member it was for had some repeated syncing and set-up issues the device appears to be working well with minor tech problems here and there.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,and Functional Suitability
B019VM3F2M,3,The battery charger has basically been failing to charge reliably for the last couple of months now and will likely need replacing.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"We had expected an above average to excellent device based on reviews but the Fitbit Blaze Smart Fitness Watch appears to be basically just slightly better than average and now with the failing charger, long term reliability is in question.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I had a Fitbit Charge HR and a Pebble Watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I upgraded to the Blaze in order to have everything on one device.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I have been reasonably happy, but there are a few functions that the Pebble performs better than the FitBit.","2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The vibration motor on the Pebble is much stronger than the one on Blaze.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have a hard time noticing it when I am awake and there is no way the Blaze vibration alarm would wake me up.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The notifications function is not as reliable and full featured as the Pebble was, but that is a software issue that hopefully will be fixed soon.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,and feature request
B019VM3F2M,4,"Bottom line is that when I decided to go to one device, I knew that my choices were a smart watch that has added fitness tracking or a fitness tracker that has added smart watch functionality.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I decided that I thought fitness tracking was more complex and more important to me and went with the Fitbit Blaze.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I am betting that it will be easier for Fitbit to upgrade the smart watch functionality to compete with the Pebble than it will be for Pebble to upgrade to match the Fitbit tracker functionality.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I am happy with the Blaze as my one device choice, but I am anxiously awaiting software updates from Fitbit.","2,3",,Feature Request,

B019VM3F2M,2,The menu controls are not that great and could use some improvement.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,2,I feel that its way over priced at $200.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It should be more like $100.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Cons: Battery keeps getting worse and worse.,1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,2,The watch itself feels cheap and doesn't feel like its well made.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch should be waterproof like other manufactures of these types of watches.,1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I am really disappointed with the quality and consistency of the heart rate monitoring.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,A little walk with my kids reads as a more strenuous workout than an hour-long crossfit session.,"1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"This very expensive watch is basically a big, unattractive black square on my wrist that vibrates to remind me to walk.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"So, so disappointed",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Not recommended for biking.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,5,So much better than an apple watch to me.,"3,5",,,

B019VM3F2M,2,"phone pairing will stop during exercise, is really bad.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Does not give a warning if you are not active like other trackers.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,UPDATE: After checking the competition I would have never bought this watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Way too dependent on the phone.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,the sync with the phone is just really bad.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"if i could after 3 months with it, I would return it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I purchased this to replace a FitBit Charge 2 that stopped working after a year.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,When researching a replacement tracker what I liked most about this one was the ability of changing out the bands for variety.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Unfortunately the band that came with the item must have been faulty, one of the latches that allow the removal of the band kept coming undone.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Before I could change out the band I looked down to see the time and it was gone!,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It was very disappointing to loose something within 3 weeks of owning it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Last time,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I have been a fan of Fitbit for years; I've always loved their products.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,When my Charge HR died for the last time my husband convinced me to try a Garmin.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I did, ended up disliking it and returned it to purchase the Blaze instead.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I loved being back to Fitbit with all the options I loved.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I have owned the Blaze for less than two months and if I do not charge it fully, every single night, the battery is dead by 5pm the next day.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The battery lasted longer in the beginning but never more than 3 days.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,My husbands Garmin lasts almost a full week before he needs to charge it.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I guess it is time to try another product.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,So far lots of fun.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It seems to take some experimenting on getting data from apps to sync cohesively.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"For Example: if I am biking, I use both the Fitbit and Map My Ride app I get all of the metrics collectively, so the fitbit says I burned 2x calories, biked for 2x time and so on.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,I would prefer it to know that I couldn't be riding 2 different bikes at the same time.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,I also find a large discrepancy in the mileage and calorie burn.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If I use just the Map My Ride app the fitbit gives me metrics for having climbed multiple stories, due to the elevation rises on my bike ride presumably.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I use the My Fitness pal app as well and it again takes the metrics and combines them collectively, I would like to see a setting to choose which one I want to use data from.",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,"It looks good, light weight, screen is easy to see and use.","1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,it seems that it was released before it should have been because the fitbit instructions suck and most of the functions I have discovered have come from google searches.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I had to purchase this for a fitness course that I took in high school.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I don't have the rash problem that so many people were talking about on here, however I made sure not to wear it while it was wet or while I was wet, so that may have something to do with that.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like the call and text features, but I hardly use them.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,My grandma on the other hand uses them all of the time.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,My absolute favorite feature (and the only reason I still wear the watch) is the silent alarm.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I've always hated a loud, blaring alarm sound and this alarm feature on this watch wakes me up much happier than the loud alarm on my phone.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,My biggest problem with this watch is the fact that most of the time in order to get it to sync to my phone I have to shut down the watch and turn it back on.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love my Fitbit blaze!!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Great addition to my fitness journey!!,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,5,!,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Seriously this thing needs like 20 x the watch faces it has like 10.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,It holds a charge a decent amount of time.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,But don't expect to charge it on the go unless you remember it's weird charger.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I wish it could just plug into a standard phone charger.,1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It is a good fitness tracker but all its smart watch functions seem dated compared to anything else.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,I ended up going back to my Samsung Gear 2 over this.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I purchased this as a replacement for my Fitbit One and a basic smart watch.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I had to uninstall and reinstall the Fitbit app on my phone to get it to connect the first time, but since then haven't had an issue.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Getting phone notifications took me a while to figure out, as the Blaze showed as connected through Bluetooth but I wasn't getting the notifications.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It was a simple solution (on the Blaze, under settings, Bluetooth classic had to be on then I could find it with my phone) and now notifications and syncing are working great.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The downsides I've found are in tracking steps.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"If I'm grocery shopping and holding the cart, steps are not tracked.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"However, if I'm driving and have that hand on the bottom part of my steering wheel, steps are tracked.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"On a positive note, the heart rate matched the one on the treadmill (from their sensors) and also on the stationary bike.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The distance for the treadmill was really close, though calorie burn estimates weren't.",1,"P,C",,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Of course, the weight I entered in the treadmill was accurate & I haven't recently updated my weight with Fitbit which could account for at least some of the difference.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love the fitbit.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love seeing messages while at work.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I bought a separate charging station so I don't have to take out the screen to charge it.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Definitely don't leave it charging longer than it needs because it will kill the battery.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love working out and knowing how efficient I'm being.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The new sleep feature that they released even tells you your sleep cycles so you can track how much rest you're getting.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,This is an upgrade for me and I love it!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I didn't find it difficult at all to learn how to charge it, set it up and use it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,If you actually READ the instructions you will not have any issues.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I think some of the reviews are a little misleading in that regard.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The wrist band is comfortable for me, I don't notice it.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,What I liked most is that it transferred my old data so it's like I didn't miss a beat.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I also like that it is is a truly customized device for you.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I almost returned this watch because it took nearly two days to charge it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Instructions that came with the watch were useless, since they only directed me to go to the Fitbit website.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Once online, I could only read how to use it by setting up an account.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,You can only set up the account by allowing it to update the device first.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,You can only update the device after it has been charged.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The charging apparatus was not exactly intuitive and I could not get detailed instructions without setting up the account, which couldn't be set up until the device had been charged.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This was very discouraging when the watch took nearly two days to charge.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Once the unit was charged and I was free to move about the Fitbit website, things started to make more sense and now I actually like it better than my traditional watch, except that I would prefer a gold trim, instead of silver, to match my wedding ring.","1,3,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I wanted to like this, but it wasn't worth $200.",3,,,

B019VM3F2M,2,"To me, it failed to function as a smart watch.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Therefore,  it was just am overpriced fitness tracker.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,You can get other fitness trackers that do more (like built in GPS) for less.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"At first I loved using this, it was cool and easy to wear and had awesome features, but ultimately I returned it because I noticed the HR monitor was completely off whenever I was doing physical activity.","1,2,3",C,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,At home or just on a slow (I do mean slow) walk it seemed accurate (I eventually compared it by taking my own HR and by using two other HR monitors) but for fast walking or jogging or running it was substantially underestimating my heart rate.,1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,4,I purchased this somewhat hesitantly after reading reviews about the mysterious pain and tingling from some users.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I charged it for about 4 hours before wearing to make sure that it was at 100%.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"When I first put it on, I'll admit I did feel something like tingling numbness, or possibly even a TENS unit.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The pain stayed local to the area around the watch for maybe half a day, and then faded into kind of an ache that also presented in my shoulder.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I can only think this has something to do with the way I carry my arm now, even though I wear it with my dominant arm.",4,,,

B019VM3F2M,4,"The Fitbit Blaze has  an amazing range of possibilities for the keep fit/keep healthy enthusiast but the key thing is to be sure, before you make the purchase, that you really want that much technology or are you actually just looking for a watch with some wrinkles, because the price is high (around $180).","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"What bothers me increasingly is that there is also a considerable loss of your privacy if you set up the Fitbit to its full capability, because you have to enable the Fitbit to communicate the data it collects on you ('sync' it) to your account and your account can be accessed by Fitbit.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I personally have concluded that I don't need all this technology but that was my mistake not Fitbit's, which is a very helpful company, its technical support is excellent and its online manual first-class.",4,,,

B019VM3F2M,1,The heart rate monitor has a light that makes it hard to wear at night (for sleep monitoring).,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Clunky to wear.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Works well, and some of the features are cool but the heart rate monitor stopped working after 1.5 years and fitbits response was basically, 'More than 365 days than when you bought it?","1,2,4","C,P",Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,4,This product is great.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"it does one important thing in my opinion, and that is that it keeps you active.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,because of this watch i am self-conscious of when i am being lazy on an specific day.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,to ear extra step i park further away when every i go out.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,i have walked around the neighborhood for hours listening to music because i was behind on my steps for the day.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,two things that i do not like that might be a deal breaker for some people are 1 - that it cannot be submerge as per the review that i have seen on you tube.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,so no showering or swimming with it.,"1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"2 - the charging device feels like it might break easily, thankfully they have a lot of option in amazon for replacements.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,my review of a good product is this.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,3,"The thing I really dislike, and mentioned by hundreds of others...the unpredictability of the 'watch' to actually function when I turn my wrist.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,It works maybe 3 out of 5 times.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Not positive but I think the longer its asleep, that is when it doesn't like to 'wake up'.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"For that reason alone, it only gets a 3 and I render the price tag way out of its league",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"1st one worked great for about a week, then a charge would only last for 4 hours, replacement from Amazon did not work at all so I called Fitbit and they sent a 3rd one.","1,7",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It will not connect to my Samsung S8 but did initially work with my Samsung Note 5.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Call to and a trip to the Sprint store did not fix the bluetooth connectivity issues!,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have had 4 different Fitbits and by far the least productive due to these issues.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Either Fitbit or Samsung need to correct this!,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I've had my blaze for over a year and the first year it worked great!,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,No complaints then.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,After a year the thing gets wonky and the charger connections need attention.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,If I didn't know any electrical engineers it would have died long ago.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Also it is now randomly shutting off for no reason.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Has plenty of battery power and just have to hit any button to turn it back on and connect back to the Bluetooth.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have been unable find anything that specifically happens to make it turn itself off.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,After buying three fitbit HR's this one seems like it will actually be around for a while.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"My problem with the HR's was always band related, this is easily remedied in this product, with a quick switch.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love the features on this too,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Unfortunately the first watch that arrived was defective and after only wearing for a couple of days the battery died and would not charge.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Fortunately I called FitBit and explained the issue and they immediately sent a replacement.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The process while annoying since I wanted to begin using the FitBit immediately is why I am giving 4 starts.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Ever since receiving the replacement I have been enjoying getting to know and use the tracking capabilities on the FitBit.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I also like how this model looks.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It works well and looks good.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love this!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I went from a surge to the blaze.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The blaze is super lightweight compared to the surge.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love all the accessories you can purchase and the colored display.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It also has a lot of clock options and you can set alarms from the fitbit rather than having to do it from the fitbit app.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,If you are a person with an active lifestyle you will probably like this tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,If you have a very sedentary job and want to use it to remind you to move more do not waste your money.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It is also one of the worst sleep trackers I have ever seen.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,It logs me as asleep when I am awake and moving.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,The calorie tracker works only moderately well when paired with My Fitness Pal even though it is a recommended compatible app.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,I would be better off going back to wearing both a watch and a less expensive tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Overall I am pretty happy with this product.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I would like to see more time screen display options and it would have been nice if this product was waterproof like the my pebble Steel.,"1,2",R,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The product is water resistant but it would have been nice where to be waterproof, also it would have been better if they would have had a magnetic charger like the Pebbles do instead of having to take the center device out and put it in a charging cradle every time",1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It worked amazing for a little under a year and now it won't keep change for more than a couple hours...,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Time on this thing hasn't worked for more than a day since it got it.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The interface works most of the time, sometimes I can't get to anything but notifications and the clock.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I feel like I wasted money and coulda got something cheaper.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Takes forever to update too.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like all the features the Blaze offers, but it has some operating issues.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,My main problem with my Blaze is that it keeps losing its connection with the app and does not sync.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have to delete it and add it back or turn my phone off and back on.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Inhad this problem in the beginning and it seemed to finally resolve itself.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"After the last system upgrade, it started happening again several times each day.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If I had known there would be all the connection problems, I would not have purchased the Blaze and continued using mybOne.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like it, but I do not like that you can only get the Fitstar Ab workout on your watch.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,The rest of the workouts have to be viewed from the computer which defeats the whole purpose.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"It counts stairs accurately most of the time, and the steps seem to be accurate as well.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Not very aesthetically pleasing, but I guess its not meant to be a fashion statement.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,a bit disappointed.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I upgraded from a Fitbit HR (which died on me after six months for unknown reasons), my husband still wears his with no problems... the Blaze face is much bigger, which I expected, but not enough features to make that irrelevant.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,The battery lasted a few days before needing recharging when I first started wearing it.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Now it will only last one day before needing recharging, regardless of how much I'm using it.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I've turned off the notifications and such.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Maybe I just have bad luck with these things.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,:-( I enjoyed the clock on the face and the pulse/steps/calories burned features.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Everyone thinks it's an Apple IWatch.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I wanted to love this watch and for the first few weeks I did.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,However it has a major flaw.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The connected GPS is not accurate.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I mountain bike.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The other night I went on a ride that I know has over 1200 feet of elevation gain and is over a 9 mile ride.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,At the end of the ride I checked my Fitbit and it shows elevation gain of 320 feet and only 4.5 miles.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,So it makes it pretty much useless.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Another pet peeve is what's the point of the new update that allows you set set your goal to move through out the day but it doesn't have an actual notification to remind you?,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,The app tells you if you moved enough during that time but it doesn't actually remind you to move.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Really like the tracking capabilities of the Fitbit Blaze, heart rate, steps, stairs and sleep to name a few.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It's a sharp looking watch, I also purchased a silver wrist band to go with the black.","1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The battery isn't the longest lasting, this lasts for about three days, but the charging of the device is simple, poop it out of the wrist band and into the charger, charge complete within a couple of hours.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The only real complaint that I have, besides the relatively short battery life ( I have had a Fibit Charge and a Pebble, both have charges lasting about five days) is the watches notice/alarm vibration.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"This device, when compared to my two previous devices, has a vibration that does the job but can be easily missed if you're preoccupied.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"You knew when the alarms/vibration on my previous devices were going off, this one is not as noticeable.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Still a very nice device.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I would recommend its purchase.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Functionally, I like the Blaze: it has longer battery life than prior models, it tracks a variety of exercises, heart rate, and sleep very nicely.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,But one big flaw costs it a star or two: the vibration alert I liked so much on my Charge HR model is virtually gone.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"It DOES have a vibration, but it's barely discernible.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you're exercising or in a public place, there's very little chance you'll feel or hear the alert about various notifications, and you may not be woken up by its vibrating alarm.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,i find this extremely disappointing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I'm not going to return it because I like its look and its general operation, but I'll be wearing by old Charge HR to bed so I can be sure to wake up.","1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Disappointing that Fitbit did not manage to design this correctly.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Initially the watch was great.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"3 months later it doesn't hold a charge for more than 30 hours and that is without using bluetooth, music, etc.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Very unfortunate that I invested so much money (also bought an additional leather band) and it lasted less than 3 months.,"1,3,4",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"First of all, love this Fitbit.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I wear it every day almost all day.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Positives: -tells you where to improve -helps you reach your goals -comfterble -it looks nice Cons: -the metal scratches VERY easy.,"1,2","C,P",Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,-it is not waterproof -dust and dirt shows very easy.,1,"C,P",,

B019VM3F2M,4,"Overall, I do love this Fitbit and would choose this one over any of the others.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Love the Fitbit Blaze, the only thing I would change is the watchband, it makes me sweaty.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,One huge benefit is the stopwatch; since I am a nurse this comes in very handy.,2,,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,5,!,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I decided that with my tax returns I would do something healthy for myself, and decided that upgrading from the flex to the blaze was the best thing to do.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was a little hesitant to do so because the difference in the sizes made me think that I would regret just how big the blaze was compared to the flex that I would never be able to get use to it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I did.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Instantly.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,And I am absolutely in love with it!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I love the color screen, and how you can change the clock face settings to show how active you have been minute to minute.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The floors are accurate and I absolutly LOVE being able to see how many steps I have just by looking at my wrist.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The fact that they have small workouts to get the blood pumping a swipe away is perfect, especially since it teaches you how to do each move.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You are able to switch out the watch bands (something that swayed me to the flex) possible negatives: Checking texts is pretty awesome, but I wish that it was a little more interactive.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Even if it means that you can just open up a larger text message to view all of it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The heart rate moniter seems to be a little high, even when I move the blaze up my wrist, as instructed by fitbit, it is not getting near what Im actually reading for my resting heart rate I wish there was a way to set a reminder that would go off if you are too sedentary, so that it pushes you more to move.",1,"C,R",,
B019VM3F2M,5,This tool has helped me retrain my body and my lifestyle into something a lot more healthy.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"With the meal tracking, I taught myself what 1700-2000 calories a day looks like with healthy foods compared to bad ones.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I now know I wasn't walking nearly as much as I previously thought.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I know my sleep is pretty lousy and needs improving.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,All these pieces of knowledge are keys to getting healthy.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Only issue I've had so far is with the stair stepping count being incorrect.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Drove from Nashville, TN to MS and it said I climbed 100 flights of stairs.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I know it's not 100% accurate, but is a great tool for weight loss.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The battery lasts me about 2-3 days on a full charge, so it's pretty nice there also.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I bought this product because it said it was new, but come to find out, it was refurbished.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I was the second owner.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"First bought in July 2016, fixed in Jan 2017 and sold to me.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Giving 3 stars because this product was owned before.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Other than getting a refurbished Fitbit, this thing got me more motivated to workout.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I can tell when my anxiety is kicking in (due to ptsd) because my heart rate will rise.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Before this I counldnt tell until i was having chest pains.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Loved it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Feel naked without it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I've used this watch continuously since I bought it two months ago.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Durability: The battery lasts for several days, long enough that it isn't a nuisance to take it off and charge it.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Reliability: I've used it in several cases where I knew my heart rate was over 150 and it registered as below 135.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Otherwise, it seems accurate.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Comfort: It feels like any other watch.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,No discomfort when worn regularly for extended periods.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I only take it off to shower and recharge.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Features: I mainly use it for monitoring heart rate, but I bought it specifically to record my sleep habits.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The record of minutes and number of times restless and awake at night help me know if I need to change something in my habits.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Overall: I think this watch would be excellent if it worked for high-intensity exercise with peak heart rate levels.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4,Enjoying it alot.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Using it to connect with other friends trying to move more.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The heart rate monitor is really helpful for me which is why I went with this model.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I saw someone else wearing it who showed me the extra features and since I do not normally wear a watch most folks don't know it is a fitbit at first look.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,One thing I recommend for any of the fit bits is to go into settings and choose your own step goal.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The application defaults to 10K steps which for me is about 4 miles.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I know a bunch of folks that stopped using theirs because they got discouraged by the 10k.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Set your own goal and you may be much happier with the product long term.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I put mine at 5K and find it is just enough to get me out for a walk at night to finish off the goal.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I wanted a smatwatch that had a heartrate monitor, sleep tracking and would not need to be charged every day.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,This one fits the bill.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Notifications are still a little off sometimes and do not come in right away.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Over all it's a good smartwatch for the price and what it does.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"When I first got it in March, from time to time it would not connect to my Bluetooth.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Then it would happen more frequently and I usually was able to fix it myself.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"Now, for over a week I have not been able to connect it.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,I just use it as a watch now.,"4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Can't use any of the features I bought the damn thing for.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,I've tried every trouble shooting thing possible and nothing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,I should've returned it at the first sign of flaw.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I went on a whim to purchase this for myself so far I'm very pleased with the whole product I'm able to work in it without it getting in the way.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It did cause a rash on my arm after prolonged wear so now I switch it back and forth day to day till my wrist is used to it.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,(Same thing used to happen with watches) over all very happy it has definitely helped me try to be more active and the app helps me track my eating sleeping water intake habits as well.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Very happy and you will be to or my name isnt Bobdole,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I had a Surge but got tired of the constant rash despite following the fitbit 'skin care' guide, so decided to try out the Blaze.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I like it much better than the Surge, but apparently fitbit didn't learn their lesson from the many many complaining users and appear to have used the same band material.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I switched over to an off brand leather band which I love.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"While I think the Blaze is a 5 star, knocking a star off as a product that costs this much and has had so many complaints should have a band that doesn't cause so many skin issues.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I am really not sure who the fitbit dermatologists are, but maybe a new group needs to be consulted.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It is a good product but there are some issues syncing  with the iphone.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,3,But the blaze?,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,just don't know.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Good watch and exercise tracker.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,4,No where near the functions of the Apple Watch but no where near the price either,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This little watch has helped me to lose some weight and has made me much more mindful to get up and get exercise.,"3,4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have also used their calorie tracking app to keep track of how much I've consumed vs. burned.,"4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I'm not Mr. Triathlon and don't even go to the gym, but this watch definitely has helped me to pay more attention to my health and keeping moving with walks and exercise during the day.","3,4",,,

B019VM3F2M,4,"As far as fitness trackers go, I find the Fitbit Blaze to be both functional and stylish.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"In addition to acting as a pedometer, it also will take phone and text notifications and has a heart rate monitor that helps track calories burned and heart rate.",2,,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,4,The major drawbacks that I've noticed so far are that my right wrist keeps getting a rash.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"My left wrist does not react in the same way, so I'm not sure what's going on.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Additionally, I find the sleep tracker a bit inaccurate since when I feel I sleep better it says I've slept worse.",2,,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,5,It didn't matter how I set up the display I still had to press the button to see the distance.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,On the Blaze the distance and time show up on the Exercise screen that displays when you flip up your wrist.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Blaze also seems to be more accurate on reporting distance walked even indoors.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The band is very comfortable and the entire device is lightweight.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was a little worried that it would be too large for my wrist but it fits perfectly and is actually more comfortable than the Charge HR.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Blaze lays flatter so it doesn't get caught up on cuffs of my shirt making it much more clothing friendly.Overall I am very satisfied with the Blaze.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Bought this for my wife for our anniversary.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Helps her to focus in on where her workouts are or are not efficient.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The sleep monitoring function has been very telling, as she has discovered that her 'restful' periods are not as they should be, and is allowing her to seek advice in order to improve her sleep.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Had one small glitch with it months kitchen when some water got on the sensors.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The screen kept flashing on and off rapidly.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Quickly found the reset sequence via Google and have been glitch free for several months,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I love my Blaze, it's so cute and functional.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I had a Charge HR before, and I love this one way more.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I like the customization available with the watch face.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You can change it to digital clock if you want, which I find very convenient.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's easier to start/stop workouts by swiping left and selecting workout on the touch screen, which is easier than remembering which combination of buttons to push on the HR.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I bought a stand charger which makes charging it a lot less hassle, you don't have to take it out of the band if you purchase the stand charger rather than the charger it comes with, makes life easier.","1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I bought my mom and dad Blaze's for Christmas and they LOVE them, they also love the fitbit app and the ability to be friends on the app and challenging and encouraging everyone.","2,3,4",,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,4,I get excited to see the steps go up throughout the day and find myself more aware of my hourly movements.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Clean lines and bold style - I can wear it with anything in my closet and look forward to getting a leather band for it.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,CONS: I don't 'love' it because it can't get wet like a standard athletic watch.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Chasing a toddler around - I could use a little more durability.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"And as a deep sleeper, I don't feel the vibrations as a morning alarm, I wish it had a chime feature or a stronger vibration.",1,"C,R",,
B019VM3F2M,4,This is a good product which could be great.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Fitbit owners are people who are interested in tracking their fitness regimes.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Many of us like to swim and this product is not waterproof; I am not talking about SCUBA but surface swimming such as in a pool.,"1,4",R,,

B019VM3F2M,4,"I like being able to easily track my activities, particularly my heart rate as I am recovering from open heart surgery.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Another reason for my less that top rating is that my Blaze is not as accurate as my Charge; I bought the Blaze to replace the Charge primarily due to its screen.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I know Fitbit has recently released Fitbit Flex 2 which is waterproof but it does not have a screen so that one can easily monitor the workout results; therefore I will not buy it.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Is NOT compatible with Samsung galaxy s8 plus.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Can not receive notifications.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Called Fitbit support and they told me sorry my phone is too new and they don't know when they will update their system to be compatible with the S8 Plus.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"This is unacceptable to me for the simple fact that I have a new phone so these functions should work, not to mention the fact that they State you can receive notifications.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Nowhere on the product purchase information does it tell you which phones are compatible in which are not.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I spent $150 on this and I am very disappointed than I cannot receive text messages or see who is calling,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I had my Blaze for 9 months.,4,,,

B019VM3F2M,3,Which it will work for the first two calls then back to square one.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,If you are looking for a smart watch just stick to an actual smart watch like the Galaxy Gear or an Apple watch if you have an iPhone.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The fitness features work well but for that you might as well save some money and just get the Charge HR.,"3,5",,,
