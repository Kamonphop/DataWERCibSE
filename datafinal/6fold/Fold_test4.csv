B0106IS5XY,5,"Wow, that about sums it up, if your one of those that thinks the iWatch is just too bulky and over priced, if you don't need anything but a watch that always has the perfect time, and will alert you if you have texts and notifications, this is your watch, not to mention the time is always displayed, because it doesn't have a power hungry LED screen that needs to go to sleep to save battery power, need to see the display in the dark, just give your wrist a quick flick and a back light comes on for a few seconds.","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,

B0106IS5XY,1,Not durable,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Very simple and bad conection,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,2,Money west,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,This watch works great for what I wanted it for.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I have an iPhone 6 Plus and the pebble app.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I usually charge the battery about once a week.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The watch seems to track my steps and my sleep pattern very well.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The companion app with IOS hasn't given me any trouble yet.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,Compared to other options for IOS I feel these watches would be a good purchase for basic health tracking.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,You can also get any standard 22 mm watch band for it.,"1,5",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,10/11/16 Still loving this watch there were a few updates that pebble came out with but everything running correctly I even have it controlling my media center at the house.,"3,4,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I have the original Pebble, which works great and I have been a huge advocate for it.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"However, the Pebble Time is a complete failure in my opinion.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"It is extremely difficult to get it to pair, it constantly has errors, the user interface is horrendous, the app fails constantly (iPhone version), and the watch face is really hard to see without the backlight on.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Plus the battery life is not as good as the original, lasting about 1 day instead of 3 or 4.","1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,So it basically took all the positives of the original pebble and turned them into negatives.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I love the display/faceplate choices.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It's easy to read and see.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"What I don't like is the lack of availability of support for questions and problems, the inavalability of a manual (on-line or in the box) and how often it needs to be charged.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,My original pebble held its charge for at least 4-5 days.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The new one is telling me it needs to be charged almost every day, which I find frustrating and unacceptable.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Love my watch.,3,,,

B0106IS5XY,4,I am not able to carry my cell phone on me while working so this is nice to have.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It alerts me on calls and messages.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I held back from giving my review for the watch, but I've had this watch for two months now and I've been having problems lately.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"At first it was working great, doing all of the functions I needed it to do (i.e.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"fitness tracking, notifications for calls/texts, tracking sleep), was always connected to Bluetooth like promised.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"After a while the battery started to slack, as it seems to be dying a day after charging.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Soon after, the watch would stop connecting to my iPhone and the app -- which lost some data in the moments that it stopped working.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,Now I have a hard time with the basic functions of it.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,It keeps turning off by itself at random times and just doesn't hold up to what it used to be anymore.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"After having it for such a short period of time compared to other reviews, I think this watch should have been less than $50 than the $90 I had paid for it (at the time of purchase).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Overall I did like it because it helped me in my daily life as a busy, on-the-go theater undergrad.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Unfortunately though, I will not be buying another other ever again for its short lifespan.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,So I've had this for a week and the first thing I realize is the brightness of the watch is not that good that being said the color also is not very good and the size is small a little hard to see that part is two stars maybe even one star the band has a good feeling to it and paring with a iPhone 6 Plus is good I get all my texts and messages and phone calls that I can see before I look at my phone and there is no ring tones just a vibration I give that 3 stars I'm in construction so most of the apps are stupid .so I think it's a little pricey for what you get also the charger can fall off easy.you have to have pebbles on your phone so the watch will work well know it stopped pairing with my iPhone 7 plus,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,both complains and praise
B0106IS5XY,4,While I DO love this watch there are some obvious pitfalls.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The major one of course being that the company that manufactures and supports these watches was purchased by Fitbit and was essentially shut down.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Now while fitbit has said they will 'maintain the user experience through 2017' who can even tell what that means.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,There is no real visible support for this watch if you are in fact have difficulties with the hardware or software.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Having said all of that, I do really like this watch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Its a great, inexpensive alternative to the Apple Watch and has some wonderfully convenient features.","2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love the variety of watch faces and the ability to quickly check a text message with tracking down my phone while I'm in a meeting is priceless.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only 'problem' to speak of so far is unreliable Bluetooth connection but I can usually remedy the problem by forgetting both connection and re-pairing the watch to my iPhone.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Hopefully Fitbit will find room for Pebble support within its brand, if not, I'll enjoy this watch while I can.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The Pebble Time works really great if you don't set the bar high (I was able to buy at $60 - and well worth the price).,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The first day I thought I might return it - then I realized what it needs to be optimized (at least for iPhone).,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wouldn't expect much in terms of Pebble apps - but as a notification machine (with long battery life) for your wrist - it can't be beat.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Just make sure your notifications are set to show up on lock/closed screen - and you'll be set by how much you can get out of the watch just using that alone.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,My only gripe is turn by turn directions on Google Maps (and this may not be entirely Pebble's fault) - Google doesn't seem to notify the last direction (i.e.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,- arriving at destination on right in 300 ft).,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Other than that - love it!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,The company no longer supports this product.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,You need  to download information to the watch in order to use it.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Why is this watch even being sold if the manufacturer no longer supports it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Not an applewatch but is great for the price.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Great device to test the smartwatch waters.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,BELIEVE ME!,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,it has amazing battery life and is very functional and comfortable on the hand.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,but believe me they have the worse customer support.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"it takes them forever to reply to you around weeks, and sometimes they just answer stupid not even bothering reading the whole email.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,and their prices went up.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,your better of checking the new samsung gear s 2 or LG urbane.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,what made pebble special is battery life.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,and right now other companies are stepping their game in that department.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,go for another brand.,5,,,

B0106IS5XY,4,"For what it is and what I use it for, at this price point  - it's a smart choice.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Buyers should be aware that Pebble customer and tech support is very thin.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"No phone support, only the possibility of email advice after a significant time lag.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"While I have heard that others like their Pebble Times, in my case, the new watch is not connecting to my phone's Bluetooth..While I realize that Pebble is a startup with limited resources (and am sympathetic),  the lack of tech assistance is a real problem for me.","1,5",C,,

B0106IS5XY,5,I love the pebble watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I have worn the more expensive gear watches and many other lesser ones, but my go to watch for keeping me informed and looking good is the pebble.","3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I love the functionality better than any of the other ones.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It is a watch first with just enough notification display to be great at it's job.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Thank you Pebble.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Get one while you can.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"So here is how I rate things: 5= Exceeds expectations 4= Meets 3= Below 2= Very poor, major issues 1= Totally worthless.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Have not had this for very long, but it works just as expected.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The battery lasts for several days without needing a charge and most of the apps and notifications work as you would expect them too.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only minor thing that actually works out in my favor is that the watch will not vibrate when recieveing a message from a group text.,"1,2,4",P,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I actually like this so that my wrist is not vibrating like crazy when people are talking, but I don't feel like this was part of the design, but rather a flaw that kinda works out.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,Do not buy.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I've had this watch for 1 month and have lost it a hand full of times already.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,5,It is a very simple smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,No frills.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,But that is what I was looking for.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Also the fact that it can get wet really appeals to me.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I can shower in it and jump in a pool for a swim no problem!,"1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It shows my calendar events and text messages.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I highly recommend!,"3,4",,,

B0106IS5XY,4,"Good but display too hard to read for me,needs better back light",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Love the watch and how it last many days before needing to be recharged but it is advertised water-resistant up to 30meters which isn't the whole truth.,1,"P,C",,
B0106IS5XY,3,Seems if the water your in isn't far from the actual temperature of the watch your fine but if you are in a hot tub or even a hot bath the pressure changes and it takes on water.,"1,6",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Very sad.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I really like the watch quite a bit.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The apps on it are useful and have perfectly fit what I needed in a smart watch.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The biggest con is the charging of this phone which is why I give it 4 stars.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,When I charge the watch it someone's says it is full when it only had 2 days tops for charge.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I have to unplug it and plug back in for it to adjust.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,Really like this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I have this watch paired with an iPhone 6.,"4,5,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I had a Pebble Time Steel that a friend let me borrow for a few months that was also awesome.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I actually bought the original plastic Pebble here on Amazon, but it didn't last for much more than two week before it experienced the screen tearing issue.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,This Pebble Time has been awesome so far and I love the timeline interface.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The vibration alerts are very strong and the bluetooth range seems to be much further than the Pebble Time Steel.,"1,5",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"The only downside is that the screen is a little dimmer than I thought it would be, but I've compensated for that by using a high contrast watchface.","1,6",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,This is a great watch that does everything I want without the extra cost (and unneeded feature) of the Apple watch.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love that the Pebble Time is 'always on'.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,:),8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I read about this watch on an article about successful Kickstarter campaigns.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,And it is everything they advertised it to be.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It is an affordable, simple, and aesthetically pleasing smartwatch.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,With the simple included instructions I was easily able to get my Pebble set up and running in no time.,2,,Information Giving,

B0106IS5XY,5,I am very satisfied with what I got.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,5/5,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Company just went out of business and sod its assets to Fitbit.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,No further support for the product.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Very disappointing.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The interface is not as helpful as the original Pebble Classic, vibration is weaker, too hard to check time and date due to having to clear notifications first compared to Classic.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,The display does not mess up routinely like the Classic did which is a plus.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,Will continue to play with notifications to drop down to a bare minimum of important ones so that the watch is more useful as a watch too.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,Better haptic engine needed for a notification watch.,1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Our teenager saved up and bought this with his own money.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,He is so sad.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,It has done nothing but glitches up and had issues after issue.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,He has already stopped wearing it and decided it was a complete waste.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Sad this company got bought out by Fitbit.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It is a exceptional functional wrist watch.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I almost never have to pull out my phone.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Text with voice reply, incoming notifications, reminders, timers, skip the song, pedometer, sleep tracker, small useful apps, and most of all 5 DAYS BATTERY LIFE!","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Pebble had it right in what a smartwatch should be.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Something you don't have to reach for.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Right there, plan as can be on your wrist.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Gonna miss it...,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Simple, lightweight, water resistant smartwatch for people who don't need bells and whistles.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The build quality is solid, low power consumption and good app/phone support.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Keep in mind the price-point for this product - e.g.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"this particular Pebble watch is not a competitor to the Apple Watch or Samsung smartwatches and you won't find the usability to match those products, however this watch is 1/3 the price and I think the value is fantastic for the price.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"This watch does the simple 'wrist companion' very well with good activity/sleep tracking, notifications from your phone, microphone support and a cool color e-ink display that is very sharp and low power.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I would STRONGLY recommend third-party protection for the watch face as the metal bezel probably scratches very easily.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I recommend GadgetWraps screen/bezel protectors (they make good replacement bands too).,"1,4,5",O,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Returned before I received it, due to Pebble going out of business.","4,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Would not recommend buying one, as there will be no future support starting in December of 2016.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,These watches are phenomenal.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"However, Pebble was recently purchased by FitBit and all Pebble watches no longer have warranties or support.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Be aware of this.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,My watch corrupted and is no longer usable and there's no support to help fix this issue.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,I'm downgrading my original review to only 3 stars.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,My husband loved this watch but after less than 6 months of wearing on the weekends the band broke while he was traveling.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Watch fell through a grate in the jet way and was lost.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Watch is to expensive for band to fail so soon.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I loved this watch but be warned if you listen to your phone in the car over Bluetooth, having the watch connected while streaming music to a car will make the music skip and jump around.","1,2",O,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Very annoying.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,But other than that this is an amazing product.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Great interface and good features.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's too bad it can't integrate with the iPhone more.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"This is the best smart watch on the market, bar none.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Better battery life than anything else (except the pebble time steel), simple interface and I get all my notifications there so my phone can spend more time in my pocket.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I'm lowering my review from 5 stars to 3 because fitbit already made me give them an email address as part of the newest update, and randomly removed some apps from my watch.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,It's only a matter of time before they kill everything pebble related - why compete when you can crush instead?,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Nice watch for the money!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I'd love to be able to tweak it more but the basics are indeed present... Also small learning curve for do's & don'ts to minimize heavy battery drain.,"1,2",O,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,4,For example watch faces that poll for the weather temp or have continual animation will definitely drain the battery at stronger rate than a simple analog watch face with out the second-hand.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,screen not to clear,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Worked great, dead in a few months.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Bad product, after 3 month of using this watch the battery doesn't charge or charging just for 1 day of use even it says Fully Charged do not by this watch, now I have to trash it",1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,5,"I run a darkroom and need to time my film processing, this is best watch and timer i have found bar none.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I use the Multi Timer app and its been perfect for what i need.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Its also a great watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I bought this one to replace an original Time that was from the kickstarter, i got that one second hand.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The original one was a bit beat up when i got it and the vibration motor had problems so i got this replacement.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Very basic and cheaply made.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Mine fell apart within a month..,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The end pieces of the band broke off so I can no longer wear it.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Haven't even bothered to try repairing it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Your better off without this product.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Trust me.,"4,8",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Spend the money on a really nice brand/model..,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Watch isn't being supported any more by Pebble and I was disappointed with how easily the case scratches.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"These 2 watches came in worse wear than I expected, but they work.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"New bands, screen protectors and skins made them presentable enough as gifts to preteens.","1,6",O,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"However, with the demise of Pebble I wish I had made a different purchase.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Love the number of apps available for this.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"But, one bit of warning.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Although you can initiat calls from the Pebble Time, you cannot actually talk with it since it does not have a speaker (just a microphone).",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"That was disappointing to find out, but not a deal breaker.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The other issue as others have noted is the poor battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I have yet to get much more that 2 full days out of a single charge.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Otherwise, I love how the watch fits.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,wasn't for me.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,i used the original moto 360 with the touch screen.,"1,4",O,,
B0106IS5XY,3,going from that to this just didnt do it for me.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,no actual problem with use.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,just didn't like the lack of a touch screen.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Got the PT after heard aboyt Fitbit acquiring Pebble.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Decided to get it becuase I knew it's going to be usful for me anyway.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The watch is great.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Contrast is lower on this comparing to the OG (Which I have) but still good enough.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only problem I have is the fact every 3-4 weeks I get the SOS screen which says I need to restore the watch software.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Can't tell what's the reason but for now I can leave with it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Pebble is no more exists but this watch is still the best because it does what our smartwatch need to do and for 5-6 days + when you out of battery you still can see the hour for about 12 hours,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,So far has been a awesome watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Biggest thing I went for on this watch was how long the battery lasted compared to most other watches and last pretty long though like anything with a battery not sure how long in general the battery's lifespan.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Open package received.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Disappointed.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,The watch itself seems good.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,a perfect imitation apple iWatch it doesn't have all the same features but still acts the same.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,It's blutooth enabled to work well with your iphones.,"1,2",O,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,thou I don't have much faith in the wrist band.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I think it might be great but I don't know if it will last a very long time.,1,I,,
B0106IS5XY,5,More to come when I give it to my little brother as a birthday gift,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I have not been able to use this watch yet because it requires some sort of Pebble app with a Pebble account to even turn the damn thing on.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"No thanks, Pebble.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Form factor is nice, though.",1,P,,

B0106IS5XY,5,Does everything I want it to.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Shows notifications and works well with my iPhone 7.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Highly recommended if you want a smart watch but do not want to spend as much as a Samsung gear or a iWatch,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Bought it for my husband.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It was one of the few watches that had even the possibility of being Blackberry compatible.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The compatibility  is glitchy even after calling support, watching videos etc.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,But he uses it for a pedometer and as a regular old watch and when it decides not to be glitchy he can get his email and monitor his phone calls.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,All in all the product is not bad.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,We imagine that it would be spot on for an android phone.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The styling is very nice and so we are hoping for some app upgrade that will get rid of the glitches.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,3,All in all for the price we are good with the purchase.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"No problem with the transaction: timely delivery, good price, but the watch itself leaves a bit to be desired.","3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I get no more than 24 hours use before the watch stops working and needs to be charged.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, the typeface is tiny, and the watch itself feels a little too small for practical use.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Not as glitzy as an Apple watch or a Moto 360, but very functional with a great battery.","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only problem is that the buttons feel kinda bad on the plastic model.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The metal version is definitely better.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"And since all interactions are done through the buttons, it would be nice to have them feel a little more clicky and less mushy.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Worked for 6 months and then died.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Pebble support takes forever to get back to you or ignores you completely.,7,,,

B0106IS5XY,5,"I have no internist in having a speaker phone on my watch, so even though a lot of people think that is a short coming of the Pebble watches, I think it helps keep the Pebble's price down.","1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It does not have the same screen tearing problem that the original Pebble's got after a year or two.,"1,4,5",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The Pebble Time is a very reliable and sturdy watch, which is a good thing since the Pebble company does not exist anymore (bought and dismantled by Fit Bit).",1,P,,

B0106IS5XY,4,Thanx to e-paper screen battery life is good.,1,P,,

B0106IS5XY,4,It is very light weight and super comfortable.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I would highly recommend putting a bezel sticker and screen protector on front to protect it from scratches.(i.e.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,slick wraps or gadget wraps) I prefer the buttons over a touch screen as my old moto 360 was always accidentally being activated.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you are looking for a perfect basic fitness watch that is waterproof, has a long battery life...This is it.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only complaints are that the screen isn't vivid and bright but that is what gives it such a long battery life.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,3,I had two major issues:  The watch would not stay connected to my iPhone 6 plus.,"2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,I would have to go into the phone and open the app over and over to keep it connected.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,The other major issue is the display size.,1,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Its too small to see most watch faces.,1,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I would buy another one if the display size was increased and the connection issues resolved.,"1,2",R,Information Giving,"Human Usability, Compatibility"
B0106IS5XY,2,Poor battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Lasted 2 days.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I contacted pebble and they basically had me run with nothing else operating which lasted another day or two.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Basically I purchased for notifications from outlook and for long battery life with the expectation I would only need to charge On weekends.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,This failed.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The analog watch face I liked with no second hand reduced battery life by a day.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"with the battery life I had and the fact I stopped using as a result, I would have been better served by an Apple Watch.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Maybe others will have better luck.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Pebble never identified the product as flawed when I reported issues and I never received support that fixed the issue.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I purchased this watch after owning a Moto 360 for 2 years.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I was disappointed when the battter in the Moto watch failed and discoverd it couldn't be replaced.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The price was right for the Pebble and it serves the purpose I want in a smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,To me it makes no sense to pay a premium price for a smartwatch when the battery can't be replaced.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"As a former owner of the original Pebble (which resulted in defective watches three times but I was still loyal since they were all replaced under warranty), I really like the functionality of the Pebble Time and the always on screen.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,I can live without all of the Android apps as this does everything I need in terms of notifications and the like with somewhat better battery life (usually 3 or 4 days max though - not the advertised length).,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,Where it falls really short is the material used for the bezel and the watch band.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I did see others comment on how easy the bezel scratches but chose to take that risk.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Believe me, it does easily scratch -- I am by no means rough with any electronic equipment I own and out of the blue noticed two scratches on the bezel.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Really disappointed as now there are mars on it that can't be removed.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Second issue is the original band included.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"While it was comfortable, after a period of time I started developing a rash where the band meets the skin.","1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,So had to purchase a leather band for it which works fine.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"So, without the bad bezel and band, this would have been 4 stars and if battery life held true to what is advertised it would be 5 stars.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Apparently discontinued item  but no matter.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I use it to track steps at gym and it works.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"++++Yeah, Pebble the company has gone bankrupt, so be aware of this before ordering.++++ However I'm a computer guy so I ordered one anyway.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I loved my Pebble Classic and was afraid these would be pulled from sale or the price would go up once they started to run out.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Plus it's already only half the original $150 price and it works great (like the original, but color).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,As of this writing (12/24/16) the app still functions so the watches work fine.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,This could possibly change sometime in the future as the app requires you to create a Pebble account before it will connect to the watch (or do anything).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"But they do have a very big user-developer following, so hopefully they will be able to keep things running and Fitbit will let them (and/or not go out of their way to shut things down).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"***** Update ***** On April 4, 2017 the Pebble app was updated to no longer require or use any cloud based services in order for the watches to function.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"They now get all info such as weather, location etc., directly from your smartphone.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,This means the watches will continue to have full functionality regardless of any online presence.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"This is the second time I've ordered a Pebble smartwatch from Amazon and it doesn't work, it just keeps bootlooping despite whatever fix I try .","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I'm really disappointed.This is a shame and I may just have to take my business somewhere else.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The face of the watch scratched.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I went swimming with it because a waterproof watch should be a sport watch.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I can no longer comfortably read the watch face because of the scratches that appeared when I came out of the river,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Not worth the wait - Soft Plastic Soft Band/Strap, attracts Dust and never looks Clean.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Apps - just ordinary.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,Battery Life -maybe about 7 day's at a pinch.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Overall - Disappointing,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,good,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Watch works fine but the charging cable has a pin that is too short and I can't charge the watch very well,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wanted a small smartwatch that wouldn't overwhelm my small wrists.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I thought this would be a good introduction into smartwatches, since it's relatively inexpensive.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's actually everything I was looking for in a watch, and I haven't felt the need to get any other smartwatch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I love the physical buttons, that allow me to dismiss notifications without having to look down.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's great for text messaging, especially since you can dictate your messages into the little microphone.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I get about 5 days of battery life out of it before charging.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's actually waterproof, so I wear it in the shower.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I've swam with it in the pool and at a lake.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I purchased this for my husband about a month ago.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"It worked properly for maybe 2 weeks, but then it started constantly losing Bluetooth connection.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"We did multiple factory resets (as suggested online - his phone has the proper version of Android), but now it won't even connect at all.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,The seller said they won't help since it's a tech support issue.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,And Pebble doesn't really support this model anymore since it's an older one.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Don't waste your money on this.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Spend a little more and get a supported version.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is a GREAT watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Bought it because I kept missing my wife's calls and texts from the phone being in my pocket.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Haven't missed a call since I have been wearing my Pebble.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The battery life is 4-5 days.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Outstanding for a smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,My husband had to return this for one major reason - if you use reading glasses the screen is too hard to see without them.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I finally got my watch set up.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I want to try another watch face but can not for some reason.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I also taped some notifications, but all it said was 'system app'...does this mean that the notification is ON or OFF ?",2,,Inquiry,
B0106IS5XY,4,The Alarm notification is important to me.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,Update:  I was able to get my new watch face...good...my watch woke me up today...but why only today...?,"1,2",P,Inquiry,
B0106IS5XY,4,I do not understand why only today,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,my first go at smart watches and i really like this one.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,i didnt want the Apple watch due to the price and im hard on watches.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This one seems to take the abuse just fine and stays charged longer than the iWatches do.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It lacks alot of the iWatches features but none that i really wanted.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Loads of bands out there for it and it looks good.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I did put a screen protector and carbonfiber skin on mine.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The pebble software on the phone is easy to use and straight forward as is most of the apps (gets kinda wierd with some weather apps),2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,pebble time smart watch is def good and has a amazing battery life but wats a deal breaker is you can't reply via text for any notification on pebble as it supports only some selected network in usa and has not text support for india at all.,"1,2,3",P,Problem Discovery,also Human Usability
B0106IS5XY,3,overall the product is good but text support would have been better.,"2,3",,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,1,I've had this watch for about 2 months now.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I wanted a basic smart watch to receive notifications on.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,This watch handles that perfectly.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"The voice dictation always disconnects, however.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,The watch would also Rialto pair with my iPhone 6s occasionally.,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"The kicker is that Pebble just announced bankruptcy yesterday (12/6/16) and now that Fitbit owns them, who knows what features will stop working.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"All warranties are now void, and a lot of pebble customers have been left to the wind.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"It's a shame because the battery life and design really made the watch worth it, even with the sometimes spotty functionality.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The Pebble time is exactly as billed, an entry level (by price, not function) non-touchscreen smart watch that is excellent for young active users.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I bought this smart watch for my daughter because it is compatible with both iOS and android and will run the apps needed for her Dexcom glucose monitor.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"One of the main selling points was the 30meter water resistance, however, the first watch died in 3 days after getting wet in the shower.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,There appeared to be a leak/poorly sealed connection between the face and body.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Amazon was fantastic and immediately replaced the watch.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Absolutely no problems with the replacement, even swimming with it to a depth of 10 feet",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I enjoy my grand child's picture on the face of the watch.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,If you are buying the pebble to monitor your steps it is NOT accurate.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Example I did 1-1/2 miles on the treadmill and it showed 360 steps.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,My fit was more accurate.,"1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Bought this watch in January 2017.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It's been a great watch until I  noticed condensation inside the glass a couple days ago.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Also, found out Pebble sold out to Fitbit.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,All warranty returns void?,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Don't waste your money.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"As of beginning of 2016, I found this to be the best smartwatch option in the market.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Superior to Android wear and Apple watch in usability, battery life, water resistance, looks and weight.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The software has been designed to not try to replace your smartphone, which all watches are terrible at.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,So this fills a sweet spot helping you with notifications so you know WHEN to reach your phone and when to carry on with life.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It is not an endless source of amusement as fancier smart watches are, but this is a perfect 'watch', it should not distract your or have you play games, just help you carry through the day without it being a concern.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Not accurate description.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Item was described as new, but it wasn't .",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Rubber band and case really dirty from use.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Although the item seems to be in good condition, at least they should describe it as used, like it is.","3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The watch works fairly well, however the outer grey band will scratch.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Didn't work properly.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have to chose between monitoring my sleep and have phone calls and messages buzzing.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love the watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Excellent battery life, typically getting around 4 days before it drops to the low battery warning at 20%.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Love that it's water resistant, I don't have to worry washing my hands about accidently destroying my $180 watch.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Animations are cutesy.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,Watchfaces are unique & I love that they can be animated too.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"The vibration alarm & the different vibration 'tones' work great for quickly distinguishing between a call, or notification.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The downside is that I've only had the watch for 2 months and it's already got scratches on both the finish around the faceplate and on the glass itself.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,That's the most disappointing part.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"2 months of normal everyday wear and I have to look through scratches to see the time :( I'm going to try a screen protector to prevent further damage, but I'm stuck with what I got.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"For a smartwatch at $180 when I purchased, I'd have expected a bit stronger scratch resistance.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I am giving this two stars as my son loves the watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It is only getting two stars because we bought in June and it stopped charging at the end of October.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Replaced charger but that did nothing.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"For the price of the watch, that is unacceptable.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"If it cost $30 then sure, fun for 5 months, but for the $108 he paid for it, not cool.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Now I see it is going for $80 some odd dollars which bothers me even more.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I have contacted the sellers to hear what they have to say and will update review accordingly.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"The watch did everything my son wanted - played music, had a cool way to change interface screen, recorded everything he wanted recorded in way of fitness, could check mail and text etc.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Other than it not charging after 5 months rendering it useless, he liked it.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I like but face a bit small and backlight too dem but other than that light weight and works good so far.,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Wish it had sound vibrates all the time.,1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I know it says Pebble Time, & the package I received said Pebble Time but, it's only a Pebble 2, with NO white screen like it shows in the picture so, BUYER BEWARE??","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Great for the first 6 months.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The battery life never lived up to what I had thought it would be.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I never got more than 3 days out of a charge, even despite doing all the suggested tricks.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I purchased mine less than a year ago, and over the last month the battery is closer to two days.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, it seems to freeze once a week where I have to do a full reboot and resynch to my phone.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,Bluetooth Connectivity is getting spottier also.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Should emphasize however that it was the best watch I have ever owned (for the first 1/2 year),3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,vibrator broke after a month's use.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Luckly amazon took it back,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I had high hopes for this watch.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I received it, put it on charge and went to the website for the app.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"The website says the company is out of business, they have no idea how much longer the watches will work, they will be no more updates and there is no more warranty.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I put it back in the box and returned it to Amazon.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,It may be a great watch but if they  won't stand behind it then I'm not interested.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"It's a neat watch, cool features, looks decent.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,But I couldn't get over the low brightness of the display.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I know it's e-paper but Amazon's own kindle is far brighter.,"1,5",O,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I would gladly sacrifice 2 days of battery life (to cut it down from 7 to 5 days) for a brighter display.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"The watch already looks like a toy, and the dim display makes it even look worse.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Don't trust the stock picture on this Amazon post as the watch is no where near as bright as the picture indicates, even when 'shaken' to activate.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"It's okay outside in the sunlight, still not great, but absolutely dim and unacceptable indoors,",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"This went on sale, and I decided to take advantage of it.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I had been watching the price of this watch for sometime, and I'm glad that I waited to buy it.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It connected to my iPhone easily, and I had no issue setting it up.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,They have different customization options that allow you to really make it your own.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The battery life is amazing, I only have to charge it maybe twice a week.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Great investment.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Text replying won't work with my iPhone,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Delivery was swift however,  product is less than expectation.","3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Can you tell me where I can get the watch fixed or replaced as the watch steamed up inside when we swim with it in a pool,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"i like it but sometimes very annoying, it hangs and reboots by it self.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,nice to own one but will definitely look for a better one.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,No like me,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,won't sinc with phone!,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,You need to coordinate it with a smart phone which I don't own,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I gave this two stars because of a very important necessity missing.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I was excited for my Pebble time to come and it did.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The only problem is that there was NO CHARGER!,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,And the item is currently dead because of it not having any charge.,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"If you are going to sell a watch without a charger, GIVE a warning next time.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Also, how about charging it fully so I can actually use it.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Disappointed.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I think the Pebble Time is a simple but great smartwatch specially when paired with Android.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Althought I have two complains: it gets scratched very easily and the ambient sensor don't work as it should to.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you're going to buy this watch, I recommend you to order a screen protector and a skin wrap to protect it as soon as posible.",5,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I bought this knowing it was discontinued but I've had it for more than a month and haven't been able to get it to work, except to count steps.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,There are virtually NO instructions on how to use.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Mind-boggling that a product like this comes with a tiny instruction page.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I may have gotten a damaged model.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Buyer beware.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I like the long battery life and watch face being on all the time.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,But the software on the Iphone for searching watch apps is a piece junk.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"When I search for new apps, many times the Iphone shows only the first page of apps list as the NEXT page button is hidden.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,

B0106IS5XY,3,"I read that refurbished models had battery life problems, that's why I put the extra money into a new model.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I am returning it for a full refund, maybe I will try another model, maybe not.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It's an ok smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It crashes all the time and resets by itself.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,The battery only last a day and a half.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Not very happy about it at all and feel like I wasted my money.,3,,,

B0106IS5XY,2,The tracking when your walking is nice and the sleep tracking feature is nice also.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"But, far less cheaper watches can do that also.","3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I wouldn't buy it again.,3,,,

B0106IS5XY,3,Item works well & as described.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"But, as I am a petite female the watch if far from attractive on my wrist.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,This watch was by far the most feminine of smart watches that would work with my cell version 4.0.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I do not need a new phone & therefore could not buy the Pebble Round.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The watch works well with the exception that I can not find a vibration that I can feel in a loud environment.,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I wanted a smart watch so I could hear my husband when he texted to ask where I was as he is in the same Large Place & could not find me.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I do feel the vibration on occasion & hope that I will adjust & be able to feel it.,"1,4",C,,

B0106IS5XY,3,"But, I would still leave out the Stars for the Unfeminine appearance.",1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,1,!,8,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,I have had the watch for almost 4 months and battery does not last the day even when fully charged.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,The bluetooth connection does not connect every time and I have to shut down watch or phone to get it to connect.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,My husband has an older version of pebble and gets days of charge.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Had I known the problems I have had with this watch I would not have purchased it, especially with the money that I paid.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Product i have bought in april 26 2016 and within 3 months  battery has issue .,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Charge doesnt last for more than a day.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have no clue how to get the support for the same,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have now had this watch for about 4 months and I love it!!!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have come to rely on it as an alarm (it vibrates instead of waking the whole house up with noise).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is a great watch for someone that does a lot of driving or cannot pull his/her phone out every five minutes.,"3,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"You can read texts and e-mails right from your watch and respond verbally, so your not spending your time logging into your phone to send a 'yes' text or e-mail.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Like I said, I love this watch!!!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I am allergic to metal and hadn't owned a watch in a couple of decades.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This watch gives me no issues.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The battery lasts anywhere from 3.5 to 6 days for me as I use it a lot.,"1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,One concern I do have is that the watch face scratches easily.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,My suggestion there is to get a protective screen cover.,"1,4",O,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"If you want a good smart watch at a great price, I suggest this one!!!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,!,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Not enough back lighting, can't see the screen indoors.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I absolutely loved this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It was my 2nd Pebble.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,But it just died last night after only having it 3 months and of course there is no recourse now that Pebble has been bought out by FitBit.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you purchase this watch, do NOT let the battery EVER run out.","1,6",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,That seems to be what causes many of the issues that cause the watch to no longer work.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I am so sad because I really, really liked this watch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I bought this watch for my son for Christmas.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,He loves it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,LOVES it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Fantastic watch - great app, user interface etc.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"However, I had NO idea that Pebble had been sold to FitBit and would no longer receive any support and long term functionality is unlikely.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Boooo.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Amazon probably needs to pull this product from it's store as the warranty and future support are all now null and void.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,We all know Pebble as a company went bankrupt but this watch I believe is definitely worth the price.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have only had it for a month and I feel as if I got my $50 use out of it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Getting a watch dedicated to a smart phone is hard nowadays because most people only have their phones for a short period of time then switch to the next best phone out there.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This watch is perfect because you can use it with whichever phone you would like and it will work great!,"3,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Very moody watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Works about 30% of the time.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,This watch is terrible.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I've had it for one day and it's been working for a few hours.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"After having some weird glithces where apps that I got for it weren't showing up, I decided to factory reset it.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Now, when I put it next to my phone, it says that the blue tooth is out of range.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Pebble's 'support' is a template sent straight into a garbage bin.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"As for charging, I plugged it in and it didn't charge.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I had $69, and I'm gonna get them back because that was a huge waste of cash, time, and energy.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I expected more out of pebble, but I suppose anything I've thought will be awesome sucked.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Pebble stopped operations as of Dec last year.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,So forget any support if it crashes and it does.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have had to reinstall the app on my iphone three times since it crashes.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It may seem strange to purchase a smartwatch from a company that no longer exists, but I wanted a reasonably priced watch that would send vibe notifications from my iPhone.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The Pebble Smartwatch meets the bill.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It looks good.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It has a battery life of about 3-4 days.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The company may be gone but the watch is still good and it works.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The future is hard to predict but for the price it is a good deal!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Had it for about 2 weeks.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Absolutely loved it!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Watch looked great, especially the color screen.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I really liked it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"However, after I went swimming, moisture got under the screen.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Since I got it third party, I didn't have a warranty.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Made my watch impossible to read, also zapped the battery so it only lasted maybe two hours.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Too expensive for me personally to get a new one.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Basically, wonderful watch, but I would really recommend AGAINST testing that water resistance.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Battery life isn't even close to what is advertised...  and I am not what you would call a 'heavy user' ;).,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Probably average 5-10 text notifications and 2-3 calendar reminders per day.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I dont use any fancy watch faces or other battery sucking applications.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Currently working with manufacturer and they may replace it, in which case I'll rerate if the replacement has better performance, but for now very disappointed.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Update.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The replacement is working well.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Still don't get quite a week out of it despite being a light user, but it works well with my android version 4.4 phone.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,Not worth it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The battery lasts 3 days and the text messages notification does not go away after checking them on the phone.,"1,2",O,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"This mainly good to raise the volume when listening to music, changing the song playing, and getting a notification of a phone call.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,The voice text messaging system sucks too.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,Just getting something more better than this piece of junk.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It's a really cool watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,However it wasn't for me.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I am very pleased with this watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It works great and holds a charge for at least a week.,"1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Charging is easy and relatively quick.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I would give it 5 stars if it would link with my loseit!,"2,5",,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,4,app.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,That is the one thing that' missing.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"In Korea,Republic of.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Can use Korean language patch.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,So I have no problem to use it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"But, when the first time.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It Has some error & factory reset several times.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,It makes me angry.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Then, now has no problem work perfectly, except 'timeline' So, it makes lost 1star.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,I really like the watch ordered one for my self  and one for my wife both of them have same problem magnets on the charger not holding the watch and not charging properly.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I'm new to the smart watch world and this watch has made it so easy to adjust to!,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Only cons are that the screen is very dim, which it seems like everyone has this complaint...Also after wearing it for two days without a skin cover on it I collected two scratches on the frame of the watch.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,You can't answer calls from the watch.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Only send text messages out.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I'm still learning something new on this watch everyday so as of now that all I can write about it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I didn't realize this product is no longer supported -I would like to return it,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,This broke after one month of easy use.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,One morning the screen just wouldn't display after charging.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Had to throw it away because Pebble was bought by FitBit and no longer offers any support.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Went out and bought an Apple watch the next day.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,What a great Bluetooth smartphone.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It syncs easily and stays connected.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I really like being able to glance at my txts and e-mails without pulling out my phone.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Attractive and lightweight.,"1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The rubber strap can make your wrist a bit sweaty if you're outside, but it's worth it.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,This watch has died after less than six months.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,It will not charge & is now a paperweight.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I got this watch originally to help me stay connected after shoulder surgery, and I count it as being one of my greatest investments since.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Being able to text without having to get uo, get all my emails and messages without having to find my phone, and even send messages for help if I couldn't reach something or needed help from a fall.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"This watch is simple, yet powerful, and such a great tool - not to mention all the neat apps and faces and designs out there, and I've even been able to design my own watch face that I can see and read without my glasses.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Unfortunately the font in the watch itself is very tough to read if one wears (or needs to be wearing) glasses.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,"They may have gone out of business and merged with the (extended dramatic eyeroll) Fitbit, this watch is still every bit as useful and connected in every way that matters.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The flood of current or previous Kickstarter backers who still answer questions and design faces and support one another is proof that this watch is now owned by the people, for the people, regardless what company bought it out from under the public's feet.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Bought this for my 14 yr old son.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"He loves it, it stays charged for several days.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,He likes the fact that you don't have to move your arm like the Apple Watch to look at the time.,"1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Looks very nice not to bulky.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"This was my first 'Smart watch' purchase, and I bought solely based on what my sister said about her pebble.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Pro: It has a very long battery life, it's water resistant to 100 meters (~333 feet) It has a nice selection of apps that can be installed to the watch itself as well as some very nice watch faces.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Con: It is not touch screen, it does not display emoji's correctly (they look more ASCI, then the modern ones), replying to text messages does not always work and when it does Google seems to get confused as to what you said (this might be Google's fault) example would be when you say the name Cassie, it interprets it as Cathy.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Also the pebble app is a real pain to setup, as it asks you 3 different times what language you want (overkill to me)",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Love this watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"It's exactly what I was looking for in a smart watch, basically a pedometer that told the time.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's also super cute and has a lottle extra than expected like being able to answer texts with voice.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Only reason it doesn't get a perfect 5 is because the firat charger it came with didn't work, but that was resolved quickly through Pebble.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The charge of the clock goes 3-4 days.,1,O,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Not seven days.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Sad situation,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Considering the price and the features (10 mts.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"water proof, apps variety, battery life), I consider the Pebble Time the better smartwatch for Android OS.","1,2,3,5",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Beware of using Android 7.0 because it messed up ALL SMARTWATHC notifications (not just Pebble).,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,With Android 6 (Marshmellow) the Pebble work just fine.,"2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The watch serves its purpose, but the interface is primative.","1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, it recommends downloading android wear app for a better experience, but the watch is incompatible with the app.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Battery lasts 2 1/2 days, so that's pretty good.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Overall...it's just an ok watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I was in the pool and later when I check my watch I saw moisture, so I put the Watch in rice for 2 days and nothing.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Its been 1 week and there still moisture.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,NOT 30meters as advertised.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Bought this product and it came broken in the package,"3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I absolutely love this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you want a smart phone on your wrist, then this probably isn't for you.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"While it is able to do a lot, it has a very simple look.","1,2",O,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,But that's not what I was looking for.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I was looking for something that is more like an actual watch, and this is the perfect combination of both.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Pros: EXTREMELY light and comfortable, looks good, simple to set up and just as simple to use, compatible with both iPhone and android, great battery life, and I love love love that it's waterproof.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,That was a huge selling point for me!,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Cons: The only cons I have is that I am unable to respond to text messages on the watch (I have an iPhone) and I do wish the screen was just a tad bit brighter.,"1,2",R,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I like that the screen is always on, but I do have to use the backlight a lot of the time, and it would be nice to avoid having to do that so much.","1,4",R,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Bottom line: if you are looking for an every day watch that can also do a lot of the same things your phone can do, then this is may very well be the watch for you.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you are looking for an exact replica of your iPhone/Android on your wrist but in a smaller version, then you might want to spend the extra couple hundred on the Apple Watch/Android Wear.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Love the Pebble but can't recommend it since they are out of business.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Way more useful than I thought it'd be.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I love the apps and silly animations (didnt think I would but it really grows on you).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Great battery life.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I can't tell you how many hours it lasts because I lose track after a few days and charge it when I think of it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Very light.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I forget its even there.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Waterproof for real!,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Ive been in the ocean in pools and the shower with no probs.,"1,4,6",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Great watch and a great deal for a hundred and something bucks!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,5 stars all day,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Couldn't go one day without it getting scratched and this was after being careful becaus of all the warnings in the reviews.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Very, very disappointed!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The screen has major scratches and smears that hinder clearly viewing the watch screen.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Watch works though, just misleading advertisement about condition by seller.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have to say this is the BEST smart watch I have ever had!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"You can text, track steps, check emails and a lot of other things.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The price is great, and in my opinion under priced.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I have had a fitbit, that died after 2 years, and I paid $150.00.","4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is way better than that watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I highly recommend this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,A great watch overall.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"That being said, I prefer the original.",5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The overall software seems much better but the screen is so much harder to read than the original.,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,You have to use the back light or have super bright sunlight in order to see this.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The original was easily viwed regardless as long as it was not pitch black,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,If you can't read it...... My eyes aren't that bad but I found it very difficult to read notifications on this device.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,I set to the largest font and brightest setting yet notifications are still too difficult to read.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,It is easier to get my phone out.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Everything else is fine.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Check this out in person before purchasing.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Someone needs to tell the young whipper snapper Pebble nerds that just because they can read things doesn't mean everybody can.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I should not need to carry my reading glasses around with me all the time simply because I want to be able to read the display.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I don't need glasses to see my phone, so I shouldn't need them to see my smartwatch either.","3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The concept is great.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I love the convenience of not having to pull out my phone when I'm in the classroom, at church, or at a meeting.","3,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"But if I see I have a notification, yet still need to take out my phone in order to be able to read it, that kind of defeats the purpose.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"In my younger days, I would have probably given this watch 5 stars.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"For only 99 bucks, It does everything that a smartwatch should do, and does it flawlessly.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"But for someone who is over 40, I guess we have to pay more for a display that we can actually see.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Now that Pebble has been bought out by FitBit, my watch barely works.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,It does not allow for watchfaces to be changed (including the ones I paid for).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,This was one of the selling points of this watch for me and now I can't do it.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have tried doing a factory reset and it still does not work.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I'm very disappointed.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I love the looks of the watch and the features.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Unfortunately, as soon as the Pebble links to my Nexus 5 phone it immediately then drops the connection (phone sees it as paired but unconnected device).",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,The directions recommend go into the phone menu and forget the Pebble and then go into the Pebble menu and forget all paired devices and try again.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"This is when I find that the right middle button is not pulling up the menu as is indicated in the troubleshooting menu, and this is when I find out that the only customer support is by email (no phone, chat, or text).",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I sent the support request email to customer support and got the response 'We are currently experiencing a higher-than-average amount of emails but we will respond to you as quickly as possible'.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Four days later and still no response--customer support is really lacking.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I like the looks and features enough to wait another week for support and I hope they can resolve the issue.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,1,As it is I give it a 1 because it is torture to see and pay for a beautiful watch and not be able to use it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I really enjoy this watch so far.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Only have had it for about 2 weeks and it's really nice and easy to use.,"2,3,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only complaint is that I've already scratched the watchface to hell.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I read that the gorilla glass was harder to scratch but clearly this is not true.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Also I've scratched the outside metal area as well.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"All cosmetic, but I would absolutely recommend buying a watchface scratch proof cover.","3,4",,,
