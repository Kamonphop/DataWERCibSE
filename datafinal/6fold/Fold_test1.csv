B019VM3F2M,4,I really like this smartwatch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I was mainly looking for an exercise/activity tracker that can also serve as a watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Apple watch was too expensive and I recently made a switch to Galaxy S7 Edge, so I decided to go with the Fitbit Blaze.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The most amazing feature is that it tracks your sleep automatically so you can just wear it after you shower at night and just fall asleep.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,It will automatically log your sleep data and sync it with your computer/phone/tablet.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Only 'flaw' of this watch, in my opinion, is that it is not water proof.",1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,4,"Other reviews suggest, however, that one can wear this device in shower.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have not yet tried that myself.,4,,,

B019VM3F2M,2,I absolutely love the features and everything the watch does except the HR monitor.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The HR monitor was the main reason I wanted the watch so I could get rid of my chest strap HR monitor.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch did very well at tracking HR while running but did a terrible job while I was lifting weights.,1,"C,P",,
B019VM3F2M,2,I would be in the middle of my lift and look down and the monitor would be stuck on 64 bpm when I know it should be up around 110ish.,1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,5,Would recommend anyone purchase a Fitbit!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Positives: FitBit Blaze provides much more accurate numbers when you are counting calories because it gives you real time updates even when you are sitting still.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,The design is beautiful and very appealing to look at.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you are not running a constant sync with your phone, the battery lasts me 3-4 days per charge which is a huge plus on smart watches.","1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The HR monitor seems very accurate when comparing it to a manual test.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Negatives:  I have had this product for just over a month and I am constantly plagued with sync issues with my iPhone.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,2,I'm not convinced it is actually tracking correctly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Very frustrating to use this watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The only thing it does seems to do accurately is record heart rate.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,1,Very disappointed in band size.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,I followed the instructions carefully and the band is way too big.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,I contacted Fitbit and they said I would need to work through Amazon to get an exchange.,7,,,

B019VM3F2M,1,"Problem was Fitbit didn't have what I wanted in stock, but Amazon did.",7,,,

B019VM3F2M,1,"I'll wear it as a watch, but I've uninstalled the app permanently.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,I realized it was a daily irritant; who needs that?,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,!,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"This was a huge impulse buy, but I'm glad I did it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Lots of great features beyond the usual step/calories/time aspects.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"As a student nurse, I take my Fitbit with me on the unit (after cleaning it) and I use the stopwatch feature to take vitals.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I love the plum band and that the watch allows me to specify whichever type of exercise I'm currently doing (elliptical, treadmill, running, etc) to get maximum accuracy.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Also really enjoy the FitStar workouts available on the watch, although I wish there were more than just a few to choose from.",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Cons: Although I fit the watch to my wrist as per the instructions, the back of the watch face  keeps abrading my skin and causing redness and irritation.","1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,If I secure the band any looser it's much too loose for accuracy.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I also find it exceedingly difficult to clean.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I love the watched itself but I'm a bit disappointed in the battery life.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I get about two days on it if I'm lucky and all the notifications are turned off.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,If I turn on notifications it's charging every day.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Also for some reason this one takes longer to link up with my Android phone where my HR2 linked up without issue and very quickly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I do like the ability to change the look of the watch screen.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,So far I'm not a fan.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch is very bulking and sits up high because it doesn't lay flat on the wrist.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Very uncomfortable.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've tried 3 different bands with it and none that make me want to wear it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've used it for one run/walk so far.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Endomondo measured it as 2.2 miles while the blaze measured only 1.7.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've used endomondo for a couple years and it's always been consistent.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Considering the watch is using the same GPS (the one in my phone) I was quite disappointed that it was so far off on the measurement.,"1,2,4",O,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,The battery life is good though.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Previously had the Fitbit Charge HR, and for a nominal upcharge (I paid $140 for this, and $130 for the Charge HR), this is a WAY better tracker.",5,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"A few of the things I liked best about this model: 1. the separation between the unit and the band - the reason I had to throw away my Charge HR was because the band separated from the unit, which made the whole thing useless, even though the electronic piece still worked fine.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"With the Blaze, a broken band can be easily replaced, and there are lots of 3rd party sellers out there so the bands are cheap 2. lots more functionality - different watch layouts, ability to choose exercise modes, call/text/email notifications, etc.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"3. you get a touchscreen interface The only feature this unit doesn't have that I want is true waterproofing - I wish I could swim with it and feel secure that it won't break, but I don't want to take that $140 risk.",1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Like with any heartrate trackers in this price range, some people will complain that the heartrate monitoring isn't super accurate, but I think those folks expect too much from a product in this price range.","1,3,4",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Last comment - unfortunately, my Blaze died after 6 months, but Fitbit's customer support was awesome, and made it super easy to request a replacement.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I supervise a team of 12, on a production line, interfacing with two upstream and one downstream departments.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I'm on my feet a lot.,8,,,

B019VM3F2M,5,I've long been a fan of the sleep tracking and heartrate monitoring offered by fitbit.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"For me, these have worked as perfectly on this device as on the Charge HR I've been wearing for about two years.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,One more great thing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I mentioned my Charge HR.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The app plays nice with both devices at once, allowing me to wear the charge during activities that would rather not be wearing the nicer Blaze, like climbing or really physical work, without losing any data.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Couldn't be happier!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This is better than the AppleWatch.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,So I wanted something to keep track of my steps.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I work at Amazon and we walk A LOT!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,but I was looking for something that could also receive text.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Since there are no phones allowed in the facility I wanted something where my husband could send a text if something was wrong at home.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Texting does not work unless your phone is nearby.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Great for exercise not for text, apps or anything else.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Pro's Nice screen Nice features Seemed relatively accurate.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Con's Disliked the side buttons which always paused my workout due to wearing gloves or wrist catching it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Just like the fitbit blaze, the wrist HR never seemed to keep up during High Intensity Workouts.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Seems wrist HR bands have ways to go yet.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"For these reasons, I returned this item.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have previously gone around with the surge and charge hr and while I liked them both ' I am enjoying the blaze even more.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It is lighter than the surge and you can almost forget that its on your hand.,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I always have my phone with me so I don't miss not having a gps on the watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The screen is ofcourse much more impressive and readable than the surge or charge and this watch can do many more actions than the limited screen on the charge you are able to pause the blaze during a run or walk which is something that cant be done on the charge.,"1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,what don't I like: 1.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It is very big and I don't especially like its shape 2. charging the watch is not easy and I am worried if the watch wont break with all the taking out and putting back in the body from its holder,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I really like this fitbit, it has a ton of band options, keeps me moving, notifies me of calls/text, and keeps me up to date with constant reminders of how out of shape I'm in (i.e.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,the fact that my heart rate goes into fat burning mode after walking up a flight of stairs).,6,,,

B019VM3F2M,4,"I updated and it failed, however there was some sort of glitch and the screen wouldn't work.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,I will say fitbit customer service is excellent and they tried to walk me through everything to reset it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It ended up not working and they offered to replace.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I sent it in a couple weeks ago and should receive my replacement soon.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Bottom line, I would recommend this product.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,If something goes wrong they will make it right.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I wish the replacement process went a little faster but they are replacing it, so I really shouldn't complain.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I purchased two Fitbit Blaze's and I would have to give them a 3/5.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've tested the GPS (mile and step distance) and it would be inaccurate between two people walking together.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I would have 15,000 steps, while the person I'm walking with would have 8.000 steps.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,I'm 6'1'' and Person B is 5'6'' so you expect the shorter person to have more strides.,4,,,

B019VM3F2M,2,"I've walked around a track which would be 1 mile, but it reports .65 miles.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,One of the main reasons I purchased this was to track my HR during workouts and it's been a hit or miss.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"After heavy deadlifts, where my heart is pounding, this would report my HR as 75...really?!!","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Not recommended...,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Bought last February.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Like the features but battery life is two days max.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Flip features works only sometimes have to push the button to get the time which is aggravating to say the least.,"1,2,6",O,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Steps about 15% inaccurate.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,HR monitor reasonably close to my chest monitor just lags in real time.,1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,2,I never wear it near water.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This is the 2nd fitbit this year that has broke.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I will probably be switching to Garmin since nobody will help me to replace at this time.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Hands down one of the best fitness watches, I wanted something comparable to my wife's apple watch but as I haven't drunk the kool-aid and don't have an apple phone I went with this and to my surprise, it does things her watch can't, like control Spotify.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's easy to pop in and out of the band's sports one for working out and fashion one for the office.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It looks like a regular watch but does so much more.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The accessories won't break the bank so if you're like me and like different watch bands then you can have numerous ones.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love the Blaze - great purchase.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I like the Blaze over the Surge.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Surge was too masculine for my small wrist.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Blaze is a smaller frame than the Surge and works for everyday wear.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The colors are nice and bright.,1,P,,

B019VM3F2M,5,It does well tracking exercise as well and I use it in tandem with my Orange Theory heart rate monitor.,"2,4",,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,5,It last about 4 days for me on a charge.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I've owned several of the fitness watches over the years, and they've all had one thing in common.",4,,,

B019VM3F2M,2,"Works, not sure how accurate.",2,,Inquiry,
B019VM3F2M,2,The Step count feature is as much as 40-50% off from my manual pedometer.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,That pedometer is off by 2-4% in itself.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Also I suffer from rapid heart beat on occasions.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This device does not pick up on that.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,2,It does give an idea of how active you are.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Having had both a fitbit flex in the past as well as an original Moto 360 smart watch; this hands down is the best of both worlds!,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I'm very impressed with the quality of the watch and the battery life (so far I'm getting about 3 days with heavy use and notifications).,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I was very surprised at how comfortable the stock band is; I didn't think I'd be able to sleep with it on, but it's actually not really noticeable.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The charger is a bit janky and it sucks you have to take the tracker out of the frame/band to charge it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Also the notification syncing for (atleast for Android) seems a bit wonky, they show up fine on the tracker, but don't sync when dismissed on one device or the other.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Another positive is that an aftermarket frame/band can really upgrade the look of your tracker.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Received an obviously used Fitbit even though paid full retail price for a new Fitbit.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The box had clearly been open before.,7,,,

B019VM3F2M,2,There was a film of dirt on the back of the watch that indicated use.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Will be returning.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The fitbit blaze has worked well so far.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It is a very useful workout tool and is pretty accurate with the readings.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have cleaned the wristband each night after use and have not run into any rash problems.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The reason I gave it 4 stars was because there are only 4 different watch faces to choose from and the battery only lasts a few days.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Other than that, this was a good investment for the price.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I love my Fitbit Blaze and wear it everyday.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I am very disappointed that it only stays charged approx.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,30-40 hours per charge.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Most other people I know that wear them sy theirs stays charged for 4-5 days!,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I won't be recommending this to others because it's not very convenient to wear and I don't get very accurate account of my activity when I'm have to charge it so often.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Very disappointed for the money how unreliable my Blaze is.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Typical Fitbit hype.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Battery lasts half as long as claimed, if that long.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Screen is very dark.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Band is HORRIBLE!,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,You have to break it down to charge it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This is my 3rd and last Fitbit product.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"They consistently have terrible quality, although good.customer service hence the 2 stars.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I would rather have a good quality fitness tracker and not have to use the customer service.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I never thought I would want or like a fitness watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Finally gave in and now I am hooked.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,First it is nice watch where you can easily change bands and needs to be charged for a few hours every five days.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Synced to my iphone easily where I can monitor sleep patterns and much more.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It tracks heartbeat along with my movements or lack there of during the day.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,You can even get text messages or alerted to calls on you phone as long as you are within bluetooth range.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,There are many more functions.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,No way to tell durability but if it lasts 2 years - I will be satisfied.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Battery life is fair!,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have to charge this watch once every 2 days!,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,If i had to buy it again I would go with the fitbit charge 2.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Its no good if you can't use all the features and keep the battery life.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,You have to shut all of the features off to keep the battery life sufficient.,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,I don't use any of the extra features because I will have to charge it daily if I do.,"1,2,6",C,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Got my Fitbit Blaze and overall it is a good watch for the price.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Like the clarity and ease of dashboard...it is designed quite well.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,It will take a while to completely understand all the ins and out.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,At the onset it is fairly intuitive to get it going except was and is tough to understand what all the buttons do....no where is explained in the accompanying collateral.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Also, there is no watch face available that shows a seconds hand or value.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,I hope the company can come up with one.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I know it will make it more useful and open more doors for sales.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"My daughter who is in the medical profession, I think it is a must for her to have a watch that has a seconds count while she works.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"She liked the Blaze so much, wanted to buy another one, but did not for the lack of seconds hand on any of the watch faces.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It seems to be everything it says it is.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It does pair with an Apple 6 phone and it is used to record activity, heart rate, and sleep analysis.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,It is used to check incoming text messages and it can be recharged without difficulty.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The Blaze has a nice appearance and the case and strap can be changed.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Like most new electronic products, it does take time to learn how to use it.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Getting started can take some time but if you have had an electronic smart watch before it will be learned quickly.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Someone with no experience could require help to get started.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I gave this watch to my wife and not being computer smart, she has learned to enjoy the watch.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Excellent choice.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I purchased this for my 14 year old son for Christmas.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,He insisted on the Fitbit instead of the Apple Watch.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"For the most part he likes it, however, one of the charging ports on the charging cradle have pushed in and I am unable to get it to pop back out leaving us unable to use either the charger or the band because it is unable to be charged.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I can't even be sure how this happened as it's not really something that gets a lot of use (the charger).,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I'm on my 3rd fit bit (2surge and 1 blaze) Friend of mine is an EMT so I figured I'll check how accurate heart monitor was against a real heart monitor.. Well it was off by at least 10-20 bpm.,"1,4,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,So when it comes down to accuracy that's out the window so is pedometer if you're active e.g..,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Pushing a grocery count if your wrist is not moving your not getting your steps....(that's why I never win weekly step challenges against my friends :-P ) The 'quick view' feature on the blaze is worse than the one on the Surge bearly picks up my wrist motion to where I end up pressing the side button..really frustrating especially when you are in the middle of running and want a quick peek on your time.,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Battery life is much better than my Surge and I feel as it's less bulky.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I wish fit bit came out with more face display designes but I'm being picky at this point.,1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you want it as nothing else as a watch then it's not a bad purchase, being that it's cheaper than the surge and has a color screen blaze is no brainer.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I like how I can customize bands by 3rd party companies.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"The watch does what it is supposed to do, but is just so large.","1,2","P,C",Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I wanted to give it to my husband as it just doesn't look right on my small wrist, but he doesn't like it either as it is so large.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"As someone who was teetering between getting an Apple Watch and the Blaze, I'm very glad I decided to get this...So far I'm really enjoy it and it has all the fitness options I want without feeling like I'm connected to my cell phone all the time.","2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The charge indeed DOES last about 5 days which I though was impressive and true to what the box said about it.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I've gotten many comments on the sleekness of it, and personally I don't think it's any more bulky than a normal watch.","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Eventually I'll get a more casual band but I love the black one!,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Great product and I recommend it for anyone who's extremely active or looking for a nice fitness watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,i think the fitbit blaze is great!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"love it so much more than my apple watch, as i didn't use any of the apps for it.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"hopefully they start integrating some kind of apps though, like My Fitness Pal or something for reminders to log food!",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,5,FitBit UI has always been my favorite UI out of all of the other fitness trackers.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love that it can be used across devices (android/iOS) instead of 'galaxy gear' or an 'apple watch' which are only compatible with their own OS.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,So I got the Fitbit as a gift for myself...,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I wanted something to track my steps and heart rate..,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,However the blaze is far from accurate...,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I had the blaze on the charger over night and when I woke up it told me I had walked 600 steps and burned 300 cAlories meanwhile it never moved..,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"When I do wear it, it makes a little square indent from the battery in the back... Also I found my fingers tingling and pain in my wrist...",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I took it off and took about 6 hours for the tingling to go away...,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Sadly nothing on this blaze is accurate,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I am a small woman and this watch is really large for me.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Be aware it does not have GPS unless you have your phone with you so this didn't really fit what I needed.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Also, it's so big that I cannot sleep with it on.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you have a larger wrist and don't need GPS, this would probably be perfect for you!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I'm using an Android 5.2.1 device with this product which may impact whether you like it or not.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"iOS may handle this device better, but unfortunately for my needs this just wasn't sufficient.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The first problem I noticed was the inability to reject calls.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,They have reserved this functionality for iOS.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"This in itself wasn't a deal breaker, but a bummer.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The second problem that did break this for me was text notifications not displaying properly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"If you use any text application beyond the stock one you will get issues, for example if you don't dismiss your texts religiously after receiving them you'll get 'X unread messages' where X is the number not yet read.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Since I use my phone as a pager via text messages, I need to be able to glance at my watch regularly to gauge priority without necessarily reading the full text.",6,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Combined with how Fitbit has generally blamed the carrier, the app, and the OS it's clear to me they will not be supporting this product nearly enough to justify the cost.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Others can utilize these functions fine, likely via Android Wear acceptable APIs.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,The fact that they chose this path screams of lazy development.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I must say that this watch is pretty slick.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Not a lot of extras but everything you need in a fitness tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I own a gym and am recommending our clients purchase fit bit products.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is the extra step involved in getting to some of the info.,2,,Problem Discovery,(good exmaple of Complaint)
B019VM3F2M,4,"for example, depending on the screen, you will have to tap a couple of times to see your heart rate, when you are not exercising.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Overall, great product and worth buying.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I would recommend this to anyone interested in keeping track of daily stats and real time exercise stats.,"3,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"First time setup completed with seemingly no issues, however since then I have had near constant sync/Bluetooth issues and have never actually gotten notifications to work.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"From other reviews on Amazon and Fitbit, it seems these issues were common on my Samsung Galaxy s8 because until recently it was not an officially compatible devices.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"However it has been officially announced compatible as of July, but these issues remain common.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Device and Fitbit resets and restarts do not help.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I will be returning this device for a different model and giving Fitbit a second chance, as I have liked previous Fitbit and their community/app features are the best in my opinion.","2,4",,Information Giving,or Human Usability
B019VM3F2M,2,Hopefully a different model will actually be compatible as they say this should be.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Pros: Design, decent price for a smart watch looking fitness tracker, Fitbit app and community systems, nice acreen Cons: frequent sync delays, Bluetooth unpairing, repairing and setup hit or miss","1,2","P,C",Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love this tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's helped me lose 15 lbs by keeping track of how many calories I burn per day and eating 500 less than that.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I used to have the charge HR, I love this one so much more, I love the music control, the workout tracking function, the sleep tracking function, and the ability to track my runs, as well as instant heart rate monitor.","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Lots of great features.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The tracker seems to work well however the app and customer support are pitiful.,"1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,can't get the verification email after many attempts and can't remove the annoying banner.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Took too many attempts to sync to iPod and customer support advised me to return the product to amazon.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Will wait it out and hopefully be able to write a better review,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"With how big this is it took a bit of getting used to wearing it, but I have worn it daily since buying it almost 5 months ago.","1,4",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I have the app on my android phone and my tablet, and I have logged in to my account on my PC as well.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The app allows me to track a lot of different things, more than I actually use in fact.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Maybe some day I will get to the point of using all of the features.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It holds a charge well, I only recharge it once a week.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It does not have to update often thankfully.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The 5-10 minute update process took over 90 minutes to complete last week, and it was that long actually out of the box when I set it up too, but I have had zero problems with it since purchase.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"This is the only fitness tracker I have owned, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say I am happy with this purchase.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"A lower price would have been great of course, but it's been worth it so far.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I really want to love my Fitbit Blaze, but it's hard to.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I love that I can read my text messages and see who is calling through the screen.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,I love that I can select exercises and just do it with the watch.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"However, I hate that the mile and step count is not accurate.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I have completed multiple 5K's where the step count is only around 4,000 steps and the mileage says 1.5 miles.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"With my Fitbit Charge, my mileage was always accurate and my steps were on point.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I really hope this is something that can be fixed in the near future because I really want to love it, and I don't.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This is my first fitness watch and I have to say I love it!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Being able to track my activity is really fun and seeing my sleep and heart rate is a great plus.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The ability to link up with myfitnesspal pushes this product over the top!,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,UPDATE: I've now owned this watch for a little over a year and have to say its proven to be a bit mediocre.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"My biggest complaints have to be the issue with syncing that sometimes occur, the shorter battery life as time passes, and the fact that the band broke completely in just a years time.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,With a price tag of $200 I assumed this product would be a lot more reliable.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"While it does what it says it does, it does not stand the test of time.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I love the watch itself, mainly because the heart monitor is almost dead on compared to other heartmonitors, however it is severely limiting in hooking up with most new phones.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I had a Volt and it worked great with it, but the Volt is fairly old and mine died.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Fun times.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"So I was looking to get a new one, and almost all new phones outside of the iphones didn't work with it.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I could get some to connect to it with 'classic' mode, but it wouldn't actually DO anything (not even teh music like it's supposed to) really unhappy with it.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Returning it for a much cheaper smart watch that will actually work with phones instead of this one.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Not worth $200, but it IS a good watch if it actually connects to your phone.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I really enjoyed being able to switch bands, and bought a few (damn me for wanting to look fashionable)","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"A lot of my family members have fitbits of some kind, so I decided to join in.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I couldn't be more satisfied with Blaze.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's intuitive and easy to use, and has a ton of great features.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The watch automatically tracks steps, distance, calories burned, floors climbed, heart rate, and has the capability to do even more beyond that.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It can track sleep cycles, when you wake up in the middle of the night, when you wake up in the morning, and even calculate 30-day averages for sleep stages and total time spent asleep.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You can also use the watch as a fitness tracker - running, walking, aerobic exercise, you name it and the Blaze can track it - except swimming.",1,"P,C",,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Though water resistant, it is not water proof, and that is one of only two downsides, the other being the lack of GPS tracking without connection to a phone.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The watch wears comfortably, the strap is fairly easy to adjust, and I don't really have any complaints about it.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You can also choose from a number of different interfaces on the watch screen, so you can make it appeal to your own personal taste.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I definitely would recommend the Fitbit Blaze to anyone looking to go above and beyond with tracking daily activity.,"3,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Not worth the money, until fitbit fixes the bugs.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Its great for the first 45 days..suddenly when you're outside of the return window, the watch takes a crap!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Its doesn't stay paired, the bluetooth consistently turns off on its own, you have to reboot the watch for the bluetooth option to reappear.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Forget about using its running feature, 9 times out of 10, it will tell you it cannot find your phone!",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,I have a Samsung S6- which their website states is a compatible device......,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've received one replacement and its just as crappy the second time around!,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,1,I have enjoyed my Fitbit blaze but after 6 months the back of the blaze (the pebble not the band ) is giving me a rash,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love the new blaze so far.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Please know I am writing this within hours of using it, so I might update this review.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I bought the surge in December 2014 and absolutely loved it and haven't gone a day without it, but I hated the bulky design and how the band would smell after high intensity cardio even with regular washing.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The biggest thing I'm excited about is the interchangeable bands, especially when they start to stink.","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I'm not a runner or hiker so the GPS thing doesn't bother me at all.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I do Insanity and Insanity max30, and this thing is pretty darn close with heart rate compared to chest strap monitors (also, virtually identical stats between the surge and the blaze, as I wore them both today during my workout).","1,4,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The new design is incredibly sleek and the photos do NOT do this product justice.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It looks a lot bigger in photos than it does on your wrist, especially compared to the surge.","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's smaller, better looking and has all the things you look for from Fitbit.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Highly recommended :) (this is a size small and has significantly longer straps than the surge small size, and I don't have extra tiny wrists, so IOW, the blaze small is more like a surge large).",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Got my fitbit and had it all set up then tried to connect it to my phone to use the music features.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Out of three different phones mine is the one that wouldn't work.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It says ASUS isn't on their list of supported phones but an older ASUS phone connected fine just like my mother in laws IPhone did.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,Guess I'll be sending it back and looking for a different device.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I absolutely love the Surge along with the band style/size and the color.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I did upgrade and this seems to suit my wants/needs better than my previous Fitbit.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The previous two bands had separated/pulled away at the screen.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I  submitted my first under the warranty...then the replacement gave me issues as well.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,This band isnt connected in the same way.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I feel it was due to my wrist being in between the small and large only size options.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,ONE downside to this band is that I'm getting color transfer from my clothing and/or keyboard so it's starting to look dingy.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I will be purchasing some off market bands to replace it!,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Pros: 1) It has a touchscreen 2) more workout features than the previous Fitbit 3) The wristband is interchangeable Cons: 1) the touchscreen sometimes freezes and you have to wait a few seconds for it to start working again.,"1,5","P,C",,
B019VM3F2M,4,The touchscreen is not as responsive as an iPhone or most Androids.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,2) the altimeter sensor needs to be recalibrated as it does not accurately calculate my stair climbing.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Many times I walk upstairs to the 2nd floor in my house and it does not input the data.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have a flight of 16 stairs.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"3) not water resistant (but the new model is at a much higher price) 4) after using this for a year, I can say that the battery life lasts up to 3.5 days on a single charge if you are actively using this device every day.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"If you hardly touch this device while wearing it, it can last up to 5.5 days on a single charge.",1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I just got my Fitbit Blaze and right away there are few things I believe are more of a nuisance and can be looked into to make it more effective for its users.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"First, there is nothing that tells you what needs to be done and I am not a psychic to know looking at a watch that says fitbit.com/setup under an arrow that I need to go online to that web address.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,A note or a small card containing step by step directions would be really helpful for users who aren't into tech stuff.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I like the interface and how easy it was to sync it up to an online account once established.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Again, would be nice if I was told I had to open an account.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It's pretty neat once you get through minor hiccups initially.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I wouldn't mind just a tad bit bigger screen and a better touch experience.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,However this gets the job done.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"So overall, it justifies the price, expected quirks, and room to improve.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Definitely worth it when compare to Apple Watch,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch worked great at the beginning didn't have any problems with anything.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,But in couple of months it's stoped syncing with my phone.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,So every time when I try to resync it I have to delet my device from apps memory or even reinstall the actual app.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,On top of everything I started to get rush and skin irritation from the band even tho I don't have any sort of allergies.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,But during that short time when watch works and I don't have any skin problems I actually really like it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Product no longer works , do we have any kind of manufacturing warranty ?",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Does not keep good charge , also erases all mememory each days .",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,At first I really liked the Blaze but it didn't take long for me to suspect that the steps were off.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I measured both the steps and the mileage against other devises and route markers.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The results varied in how far off the tracker was but each time it came in under.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Even running the same test multiple times the difference could vary by as much as 500-800 steps.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Unfortunately, due to external circumstances, I was unable to return the Blaze within the Amazon return window.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I tried calling Fitbit directly but the would not stand behind the product to allow me to return it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This is my third Fitbit purchase but it will be my last.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"After having my FitBit Blaze for a few days, I LOVE IT.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is way better than my FitBit Charge that I loved.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The screen is smooth with the touch screen, it snaps in and out easily enough, but its strong enough to hold it.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It fits great, looks great, isnt too big, and is SOOOO easy to use.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The connection to my phone is flawless and replacing the band for other colors is easy as well.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The notifications on it are definitely a huge plus.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You can read texts, see calls and answer them, see calendar things and more!",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The its great for working out as well.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The battery is pretty decent, only needing charged every 4 or 5 days.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,My only suggestion or wish is that you can get to the timing feature either quicker or you can just hold down one of the side buttons to start a timer.,1,"C,R",,
B019VM3F2M,5,I highly recommend!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I've had this Fitbit now for at least 6 months.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I really like it, but the one thing that drives me crazy is that it's hit or miss when you go to sync it to your phone.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It will sync fine, then for some reason it won't sync no matter what you do.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,I usually have to delete the watch and add it new to trick the phone into thinking it's new...and this usually works.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"As with most technology, I think Bluetooth needs to be replaced with something more reliable.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was on the fence for months about either getting a FitBit Blaze or an Apple Watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"After many reviews, I chose the FitBit Blaze because of all the fitness and health options it offers that the Apple Watch didn't.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I also didn't need all the features that the Apple Watch provided.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I love that you can change the face of the Blaze's screen, change the bands, and track your exercises and sleep pattern with the FitBit.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It also reminds me to get up and move if I haven't taken 250 steps within the hour.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I also have it set so if anyone calls or texts me, it'll let me know who's calling and will show me the text as well.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The battery life is awesome as well.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have yet to have it die on me - I've worn it for 48 hours and the battery has never gone below 'medium.',1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"With the app, it also syncs easily with My Fitness Pal.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I definitely recommend the Blaze to anyone who is really into fitness and doesn't need all of the other notifications and functions that the Apple Watch provides.,"2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,I had lots of problems and this was the third one I sent back.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Amazon did their best to help me and for that I am grateful but after talking to Fitbit they told me I wasn't getting accurate information because it worked off GPS and I needed to work out doors but I work out inside a gym and the walls block the GPS,"1,7",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I do like this Fitbit Blaze, but the battery has started draining within 6 hours after every charge.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I don't think I can return it at this late date, but is there a way to have the battery replaced?","1,4",I,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"This FitBit is pretty handy, though it doesn't notify me of any messages or calls even after I've set it up to do so.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,It does pretty good with tracking my activity and I like the feature that will take you through a workout that you choose on the Fitstar app.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Other than the battery and the lack of notifications, I like it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"But if I were to give stars for performance, I would give it a 2.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I enjoy wearing the Blaze primarily because of the watch face and menu item selections; however, the back button stopped working after less than one year.","1,2",C,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Now I avoid selecting menu items because I can't get back to the home screen unless I plug the gadget into the charger.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Hope they make the buttons better.,1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Things I like: large sized bands, and available change out bands.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Fairly easy to read and use.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Easy to read clock (when it works right.),2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Things I don't like: it isn't accurate (nowhere near as accurate as the One, and not as accurate as the Charge which was also worse than the One.)","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It won't sync with my computer (syncs okay with IOS)(which is nowhere near when I try to sync with the computer.),"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,The band isn't very comfortable even though I replaced it with a leather one.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It is just too thick and big to be as comfortable as I would like.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Battery life is decent and it is easy to charge.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Notifications work well but the ability to send a quick yes or no with a  touch would be helpful in the absence of texting.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,Won't record flights of stairs most of the time (Charge and One did; Charge was best at this.),"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"In general- designs and features are getting better, but performance is getting worse.","1,2","P,C",Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I've had my Blaze for almost a year now, and I've loved it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,until...  About 6 weeks ago the charge went from lasting ca.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,4 days to 1 day.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I contacted support via e-mail and they told me to do the things posted on their website about not properly charging even though it was clear to me the most likely cause was a faulty battery/short between the cells.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,But I figured I could live with it since it still lasted a day.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Then last night when I plugged it in to charge, and the battery icon showing it was charging didn't come on, and this morning it is completely dead.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I contacted support via their chat client and within 10 mins I had an email to get a replacement device shipped to me for free.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,*Happy Dance*,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,My FitBit Charge stopped keeping accurate time after using it for a year.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I tried out a Garmin and decided to go back to FitBit.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love my Blaze and its interface.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,It was easy to sync it with my existing app.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,However the wristband started reacting with my sweaty skin and leaving itchy bumps.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I had to replace the wristband; a small price to pay to keep using my FitBit.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I purchased my Blaze here on Amazon in November 2016, and I've been using it daily since then.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I upgraded from a Fitbit Charge HR, and after using the Blaze for awhile, I think I could have saved my money and kept the Charge.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Don't get me wrong, the Blaze is cool tech, but the reason I upgraded was really to be able to get email and text notifications on the Blaze.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"It does provide that option, but it's really more annoying than useful.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I can read texts on the screen, while email notifications are just the sender and subject, which is fine.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Call notifications are helpful too, but a lot of the time when I get a call notification, my Blaze doesn't start buzzing until the call has already gone to voice mail and by then I've missed it.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"But, my biggest disappointment is that the text/email notification option is pretty much useless because the Blaze doesn't differentiate between new notifications and ones it's already given me.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"So, I get some notifications and acknowledge them by either swiping them away or pressing 'Clear All,' but then when I get new notifications, all of the ones I already acknowledged come back too, so this feature isn't very useful.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"You can also control music on your phone (start, pause and stop play), and I use that occasionally.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I love the styling of the Blaze and it looks good on, but because it was pretty expensive compared to the Charge HR, I am almost hesitant to use it while exercising because it gets sweaty and dirty!","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Overall, I like it, but for what I can use it for, I could have kept my Charge HR.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I am amending my review and taking away one star, because four months later, my heart rate is suddenly being read at no higher than 89 bpm, which is know is absolutely inaccurate because of several reasons:  I can feel my actual heart beat pounding rapidly, two other devices showed me a HR of 140+, it's friggin Leg Day and nothing gets my heart pumping like Leg Day, so there's absolutely no way in heck my pulse is only 84 bpm.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Don't get me started on the Customer Service for Fitbit...least helpful I've ever had.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I cannot understand why Fitbit sends out rather expensive watches with no charge in the battery and no instructions on how to set it up or even how to charge it in the first place.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have gone through several Fitbits and the rechargeable batteries never last more that 12-18 months.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"On the positive side, the step counter is fairly accurate and the software is useful.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Bought this for my daughter.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I personally thought it would be really big but once I took it out of the box it's not as big as you would think.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It fit her wrist really well.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,She loves it.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's gotten her up and active.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have a fitbit too and she and I challenge each other constantly.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"She loves the text message options, she gets the entire text on the screen of her Blaze.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Get screen protectors for the face though, she is constantly bumping it around and it has saved the face from getting damaged","1,5",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,So this was a gift for my mom for Mother's Day.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"And while, I am pretty decently versed in many different technological devices, setting up the Blaze was initially very challenging without actual directions being provided in the box.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I had to look online to figure out how to set it up.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"This was particularly necessary because for whatever reason, setting up on my mom's iMac just was not working.","3,4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"For some reason, the iMac did not recognize whether the Blaze's Bluetooth was turned on and the Blaze was not helpful because it kept saying log into the fitbit website for set up.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"*For the record, I knew the iMac's Bluetooth was in working order because both the keyboard and the mouse are wireless and I was actively using them.",5,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,* It was much easier to set it up on her iPhone via the Fitbit app.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"While the Blaze does not have all the snazzy effects of the iWatch, it does have some of the same things as the iWatch, most notably, the Blaze will notify you when you have phone calls (even when your phone is on silent).","2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,You can also read text messages off the Blaze.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"My mom is definitely enjoying wearing it and being more aware of her day-to-day health and activity level, but she (i.e.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"me, in that less techie parent bugs more techie child to teach them about tech) is still learning how it works so I couldn't give it full marks.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Bought two of these for my wife and myself.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,We both loved them.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Almost to the date at 1 year old the both died.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,For 200 expect watch to last longer than that.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Now need to get a different kind and all the connections I had set up (my fitness pal, webmd, etc) are lost or take the chance on 200 dollars for 1 year of use.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Not real happy.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Update: customer service through chat and they are replacing both devices.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Very happy they stand by the product so moving the rating from 1 to 4.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,After all they both did break just short of a year.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Maybe should be a 3 but so happy with ease of customer service adding a star for that.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I wear a baby gshock for the second hand since I'm a nurse so this is too bulky to wear at work where I get most of my steps in.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It's like wearing two watches and it gets annoying.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It also doesn't push notifications most of the time when you set it to do so.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I can't access my call and text records and it really only keeps track of the fitness of  the watch.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you are buying it for the 'smart watch' aspect, don't.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you are buying it for the screen to be able to access your workout without your phone, get it!",1,P,,

B019VM3F2M,3,But it's no smart watch.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,5,We are both working out every day now because of this gadget.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It promotes competition and makes you want to get moving.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This was an easy five stars.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,1,Return window was closed 2 weeks ago and no instructions available on how to get it replaced.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Had this for 3wks and heart rate monitor died .,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Definitely Sending it back for a refund.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I bought the Blaze for my 84-year-old mother because I knew she would enjoy tracking her steps from day-to-day and tracking her heart rate.,"4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The only reason I did not give it 4 stars instead of 3 is that I purchased the Blaze specifically because the clock face is large and easy to read.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Unfortunately, during the day tha background on the face of the watch is yellow with white lettering -- making it difficult to read.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I've tried to give this feedback to the company but find it impossible to communicate with someone to request a solution or to request an improvement.,"3,4",,,

B019VM3F2M,5,"I have tested the workout function against my polar strap monitor, and both read very similar amounts of calorie burn, so it is plenty accurate for me to estimate how much I am burning during exercise.","1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I plan on buying some of the off-brand straps to make it look a bit more feminine--the only complaint I really have is that it does look a bit manly.,1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,3,Step counter is great.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Heart rate monitor not great.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"In fairness, I did swap out the rubberized band for a metal, after-market band, but even when holding securely to my arm it sometimes will not register a realistic heart rate.","1,4,5,6",C,,

B019VM3F2M,4,"Text and call notifications are nice, but not the reason I bought it.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Pros: battery - lasts ~5 days on a charge and recharges quickly; watch-based HR and sleep monitors are helpful tools in tracking overall fitness (although I'm not convinced they're particularly accurate); easy to use and understand online 'dashboard' (activity log).,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Cons: main con is a big one for me...instead of just raising/moving the watch--or even tapping the screen--and having the face wake up, I generally (90% of the time) have to push a button just to see what time it is, how much time has elapsed in my workout, or how much time I have left; generic 'workout' tracking is questionable - I have to laugh when I mow the yard and am credited with a 45 minute 'outdoor cycling' workout.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,3,"I was really excited to start wearing it, but when I opened the box, it was packaged without a charging cable...","1,4",C,,

B019VM3F2M,2,I start by saying I like the device a lot.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The reason for the 2 star is early battery failure.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've had the device for 19 months and it will only hold a charge for about 6 hours.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,At the price I paid that amounts to over $11/mo cost average to use the device.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"After some negotiating, Fitbit is sending me a new device as a replacement.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"If that device also lasts the same amount of time, that will average out to over $5.50 per month.",4,,,

B019VM3F2M,2,"BTW, the device did drop down to the 6 hour discharge window in a couple of days, but I did notice a slow progression over the last 6-8 months where it was requiring charging more and more often.",1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,5,"Once you download the app to your phone and answer a couple easy questions, the app syncs to the blaze pretty much in real-time.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Lots of bells and whistles too.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I can even see my text messages on the Blaze, and it has great reminders to get you up and moving.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Just an excellent product!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I've been using it a couple months now, and I just love it!","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"worthless will not sync with Windows 10,  Imac you need the blaze plugged into the charger and usb plugged into the imac and it took along time to figure that out given the poor tech support.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I've never been so frustrated with a device or the lack of costumer service.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"you have to use the charging pod to sync with the mac, got this for my dad and he doesn't have a Smart Phone and doesn't want one but wants to track his exercise and sleeping, so I'll have to see what he thinks about it over time.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like the design and look and hope it works out well for him fortunately he just got a Ipad air 2 which will sync wireless via the blue tooth,  but the initial set up had to be done on the Imac could not even get the pc software to download from the windows store!","1,2,4,6",P,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Works good so far, just hooked my Blaze up for its first charge.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It didn't register as charging at first.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I took it off and stuck the bottom in first, then pressed the top Blaze button before sliding into place on the charger base, then the blaze showed the charging logo.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I like this base because it seems preferable than unclicking the Blaze Watch face every time to close in charging cord.. better to just place it on a base then just pop it off an continue wearing when done charging.,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"This does everything the other FitBits do and more;  It has the few features I would want from the much more expensive iWatch (text alerts,music control, event reminders, call alert and control, silent alarms) and the display is very clear and legible.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Battery life is less than , say, the FitBit charge, but that is to be expected (I generally need to charge it every 3 days or so).","1,5",O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"My only complaint is their proprietary charging cradle; I have to think they could fit a micro-usb charging port on the watch so you could charge on the go with  a generic cable, but instead you have this clunky cradle that is too big to carry around with you and, if you are traveling, pretty impossible to find as an accessory in an electronics store.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Fortunately, there are after market suppliers on Amazon that you can order them from, which I highly recommend, both as a backup and/or to have someplace at your job, so you can charge it during downtime, as between using it to track activity AND sleep, you need to find the downtime to charge it.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I'm also not a big fan of the silicone band (talk about a sweaty wrist), but again, there are a ton of aftermarket band options out there for reasonable prices.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I really like  the Fitbit Blaze but I'm disappointed with Fitbit as a company for not listening to their customers more.,"3,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Updating the software to be more customizable would be so easy.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4,I want to be able to set up interval training and other crossfit features without buying another Fitbit.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4,The ability to just pop the Blaze out of the frame and into another is awesome - changing from a sporty look to a casual one or a more professional look takes seconds and it looks great.,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I would recommend getting a second setup of frame+bands for this though.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,And I don't know what I would've done without a screen protector - my wrist is constantly on the concrete or slapping against something when I work out- I have no idea how the rest of you manage to keep your unprotected fitbits from just exploding during a session =P,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,SAMSUNG S8 AND S8+ USERS.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Do not buy this, it won't work correctly, there is currently no support for your phone.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Notifications won't work and your workouts won't track properly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,I'd advise buying another watch or waiting till it supports the S8 line.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I received this in October and by February it stopped functioning properly.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The display no longer activated with wrist movement and the step timer would stop and start.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Bugs need to be worked out of this design.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I bought the Fitbit blaze on the reco on a friend who had the other Fitbit watch with the electrics integrated into the band, which he had to replace once or twice due to the band cracking over time.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The blaze has not disappointed one bit.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It tracks steps, syncs easily with my phone,, the only issue I have, and it is a small one, is that when I hold the handrails on the treadmill, it does not track my steps as well, c'est la vie.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The band is great, it holds a charge for roughly 5 days.","1,3",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I did forget my charger while traveling, and an aftermarket charger was available on Amazon and it shipped quickly enough to arrive before my battery went dead.","4,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,This has been a great addition to my workout regimen.,"3,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Seems to be more accurate than the other cheaper Fitbit Products.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,You can't just shake your hands or wrist to get the steps.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"If you don't really care for the looks especially the watchfaces, I'd recommend the Alta HR or Charge 2 as you get the same technical stuff for the cheaper price.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The extra $50 (compared to the Charge 2) on the long run didn't really feel like a good value.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Music control and Notification didn't seem to be all that great especially if it doesn't want to work.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,The customization of the looks was bleak and the 'watch' look got old.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Using the blaze with galaxy s6 edge.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It works great after you learn how to use it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Two issues I have with it is it tends to respond rather slow sometimes.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,The other issue is the audio control sometime works.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I found that disconnecting it from Bluetooth and reconnecting it would resolve the issue.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"FYI: text and call notification works fine on my phone but a friend using a nexus told me the notification does not always work and when making a phone call, the blaze will show that he is receiving a call from the person he is trying to call.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,The best product I have purchased all year.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I absolutely love this watch/ fitness tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The app that runs with the blaze is really easy to use.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love how it keeps up with all the stats for you on the app and watch.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love everything about this watch coming from someone that is trying to get back in shape.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This is one tool I would recommend for anyone that is active and trying to get the best edge in training they can get.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Not to mention this watch just looks great and wears just as good,  I would also like to mention the step counter and heart rate monitor are on point.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Unlike most step counter where you just move your arms and it counts as a step this one will only count actually steps.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The heart rate is dead on as I have compared this to some of the heart rate machines that my facility nurses use in their work.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Again great product and if you got the money to purchase one I highly recommend it since this will be one the best items you buy if you use it properly.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It does everything you expect from a Fitbit.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"For the price, however, Fitbit will have to start thinking about waterproofing.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The competition is really starting to give Fitbit a run for the money.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Compared to the Garmin 230 and the Withing, which looks even more like a watch, this product leaves somewhat to be desired.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"However, Fitbit has a better online community for challenges with friends and family.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"If you don't care about that though, then check out some of the other options.",8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I'm loving this product so far.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It has really motivated me to get up off my butt and move.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I'm losing weight again and hopefully, this time will hit my target goal and keep myself in a healthy range.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The heart rate monitor did stop working at one point but a reboot of the watch easily fixed that.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Update: 1/3/17 The watch is now slowly dying and not holding a full charge.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The screen is doing some weird lines across the display periodically.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I don't feel like this Fitbit was built as sturdy as some of the other models out there.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It's ok but has some irritating quirks.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The heartbeat is not accurate, especially during workouts (I'm 55, it regularly shows my rate at peak 160 plus rates for 1-2 hours).",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The count for going up stairs and up hills is very inaccurate, unlike my Fitbit One which died after 18 months which was very accurate.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Another irritant is the delay to wake up when I turn my wrist towards me to see what time it is.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,The battery does not last nearly as long as promised if you use it to track exercise.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Finally, you're supposed to be able to tap it twice to wake it up - seldom works.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I can live with all of these for now, but I doubt I'll get a new one when this one dies or recommend it to anyone unless they can fix these pt.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I absolutely love this fitbit!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is heads and tails above the flex in terms of features and functions.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It really is just like the Apple Watch (as my husband has the Apple Watch) BUT it is a fraction of the cost.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Unfortunately, I lost it within the first three weeks of owning it!",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was heartbroken and very upset with myself for losing it!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,My husband suggested I call Amazon to see if they have a buyer protection program.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I never thought in a million years they would replace the fitbit at no cost, but low and behold, they did!","4,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Amazon, you ROCK!",7,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Purchased this as a mother's day gift for a fitbit snob.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,She hated it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Was not accurate at all.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"After a week of use, she was completely jealous of my Samsung Gear 3.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I got tired of her saying mine doesn't do that.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"She is an iphone user, so I sent this back for the apple watch.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,She is now in heaven.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"It was a nice try Fitbit, but definitely a swing and a miss.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,One of the best presents I have ever gotten.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love this thing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It never leaves my wrist (unless showering).,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have lost 8 lbs in 4 weeks just walking and keeping track with this device.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's like a personal cheerleader that is always with you.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,This doesn't properly track flights of stairs.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Flights must be 10' or greater to count, you cannot be holding the hand rail, you cannot be carrying something that restricts the movement of your arm.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I found the step tracker in general to be not very accurate.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"If you're walking across a parking lot, it is fine, but if you're trying to squeeze in some last minute steps to meet your goal by stepping in place, it doesn't track them at all.","1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I thought these features were pretty basic, and this Blaze was too expensive to get this wrong.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,There are much cheaper alternatives that do just as well or better.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I was interested in this for the heart rate monitoring, which seemed accurate to me when I checked my pulse myself.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It provides a nice analysis of the heart rate.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"It was nice to get text notifications on the watch, but it also allows you to answer an incoming phone call on the watch, which is weird because then you have to go find your phone while the other party is waiting.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was looking for a replacement for the Surge because it gave me a rash due to the metal screws making contact with my skin.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It sucks to be allergic to certain metals, and this was a good option.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I had considered an Apple Watch, but I am glad I got this instead.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I don't need to respond to anyone with my watch, I don't care to play with too many apps; I just wanted a device with some music control when I work out.","2,4",,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4,"good watch, after walking for a while I noticed it made my wrist sweat, but that's to be expected.","1,3",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"charging is decent, syncing is lame though, its slow, and when doing it manually it almost refuses to about 70% of the time.","1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love.... my blaze.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have had 3 other Fitbits other than this one.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This one is much better because of the chattering aspect of it.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The other ones I have to charger u stick into the back of them; well the piece holding the charger in always broke on me.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This blaze charges differently and is way better.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,All u do is pop the screen out of the watch band and stick it in the lil charging box that it comes with.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This one should last me much longer and has tons of options for bands to get for it.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Fitbit technology etc is good as noted by others and the reason I bought one after my Fitibit Surge band broke prematurely (and which could not be replaced :(  )  But the time and effort to recharge the watch is really not acceptable.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Was no design option available that did not require a user to basically dismantle and reconstruct the watch every 5 days?,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The little clasps to lock and unlock the bands from the watch face holder is an absolute pain for people who are not highly dexterous.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This Fitbit has changed my life.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Goals are more easily accomplished with accountability, and this little gadget keeps me accountable to myself.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I walk more and exercise more.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I've lost 16 pounds since using it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's keeping me on track, and I love it.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I intend to use it for a very long time.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"It is really nice, but the band irritated my skin no matter how many times I cleaned it.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I ended up giving it to a friend because my wrist was too sensitive.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Nice watch overall but it needs to be charged every 2 days which is very annoying.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I just wanted it because the face was big and I wanted to count steps.....,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I am amazed at how much more comfortable this is too wear vs the Charge HR.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is bigger but not as tall and feels like a snug fitting watch.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,If you are on the fence and thinking about purchasing one DO NOT WAIT!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love the large color screen and how easy it is to set up.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I had the Blaze up and running in 5 minutes.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Only negatives which I knew before buying is it is not waterproof and the charger appears to be an afterthought.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is not hard to charge but just seems so unintuitive.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,A magnetic charger like the Apple Watch would have been the better approach.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,BTW I also have an Apple Watch that I gave to my son.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Fitbit is a much better fitness device than the Apple Watch and that is from someone who loves Apple products.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I enjoy the phone itself, my only issue is that it's advertised for a longer battery life-i think I read somewhere that you can go 5 days without charging.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Mine is not the case, I have to charge it every other day which is super annoying.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,My charge HR 2 went longer until I needed to charge it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Maybe it's because I bought it directly from the website and the blaze I bought through Amazon, so for those looking to buy it through Amazon, if recommend just purchasing it through the fitbit website because they seen to give out the better quality items for the same price.","3,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"the product itself is great, however i havent even had mine for a year and it needs replaced.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,i take very good care of it and everything.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,after the replacement dies i am not wasting 100+ dollars on anymore of these fitness trackers.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,at least this one lasted longer than my jawbone up2 and the replacement to that COMBINED(9 months),5,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,this is my second fitbit blaze.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I loved the first one.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"it lasted forever, easily 4-5 days even with wearing at night.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I lost it at the beach one day.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"So I bought a new one, and it must be faulty.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I can barely get two days off a full charge.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Not a major issue, but if I go out of town for a weekend, now I have to worry about bringing the charger and it's a pain in the butt.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I have it set on minimal battery consumption settings, it doesn't auto sync, the screen is dimmed, and I dont use the bluetooth for music/notifications... pretty disappointing battery life but otherwise it's great","1,2,3,6",C,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,There are a lot of good reviews on this fit bit.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I am upgrading from a flex and my blaze arrives tomorrow.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have seen complaints of people concerned and annoyed about having to pop it out of the band to charge it.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,There is a charger that clips around the device while in the band.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It runs between 7.00 and 13.00 on amazon.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"A gift for my son, he absolutely loves it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's nice looking, functional as a watch, and notifies him who is calling or texting so he doesn't have to look at his phone.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Having a sedentary job, he also likes that it reminds him to move, even if it is just to stand and stretch.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Fitbit app keeps all his stats and is easy to use.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,He said he also finds himself taking flights of stairs to see his heart rate increase.,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"If it gets him to move more, I say mission accomplished.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Would not recommend until fitbit irons out all the problems.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Main issue seems to be the battery.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It last about half the time as advertised.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Hence, your recharging every two days.","1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,My blaze actually reached the point where it could not be recharged at all.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This was within the first six months of ownership.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Now Fit bit did send me a replacement promptly but this only indicates they were aware of the Blaze battery issue.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Personally, they rushed production in order to hit the retail sector.",8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Nice watch but again it suffers badly with the battery.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Not recommended at this time.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I had a Fitbit Surge prior to this, but unfortunately the design of the wristband was poor and it broke.",5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Because I did like the Fitbit tech / ecosystem I decided to get this as a replacement.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"That said, before receiving this I thought I was really going to miss the GPS, but as it turns out I am not missing it at all!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It works in concert with my phone app to provide the same GPS data I was getting directly from my watch before.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Since I am always using my phone to play music on runs and workouts I am not missing anything.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The screen is much much better than what was on the Surge, and the design of the replaceable band is great.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Now I don't have to worry about getting a whole new device if the band broke.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"If I had to say anything negative about it, I'd say I would like more options for the home screen.",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,5,"There really wasn't any one of them I 'loved', so I settled and since have gotten used to it.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It would be fantastic if they added an option to customize it as well.. Now, if Fitbit could only design something I could swim with...","1,2",R,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,5,I own roughly 15 watches and this is my go to watch!!,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's looks great for my work as a healthcare professional and is good against sweat on a long run.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Steps and heart rate are great features as the seven minute workout is a great way to start working out.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Plus, when you get a text or call it vibrates your watch so you don't have to pull your phone right out.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Great for casual & sport uses!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,A great smart watch,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,VERY DISAPPOINTED.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I was hoping for a great fitness band that would be similar to the Apple watch but for my android.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I've been SO frustrated with just trying to keep it paired.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I printed the manual and went through everything step by step to make sure I wasn't missing anything.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I thought I finally had it working, which I did... For a couple of days.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,That has been the longest I have been able to have the info feed tho the  app where it's useful.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I don't know if I have a faulty device, but I'm sorry I purchased it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"This watch combined with the app helps me make more health conscious decisions, along with keeping track of my progress.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I regret it taking me this long to get it.,4,,,

B019VM3F2M,5,There are two things that are annoying and less of a deal breaker if you're currently on the fence on getting a Blaze.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"One, the wrist band is nice but it can be a bit of a pain in the butt when you want to take off your watch.",1,"P,C",,
B019VM3F2M,5,The reason for that is the notches in the band (think of a belt).,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"it'll stay secure on your wrist, but when you want to take it off you'll struggle a bit your first few times.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The second minor annoyance is having to re-enable notifications to sync up with your phone.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I occasionally find that notifications won't come to my Blaze even though they're enabled which would require me to go into the app, select notifications, turn off notifications and then turn them back on.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Other than that this is a neat fitness watch that fulfills my needs.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Had nothing but problems with the watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Texts do not come through as they should - get maybe 1 of every 3 texts.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Also, sends repeated texts.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I get one text on my phone, but it shows up 3 or 4 times on the watch which drains the battery.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I also reiceved a phone call that I sent to vm on my phone, however the watch shows the phone is still ringing when it is not.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Visually it is so cute and I really liked it - but the way it works is dissapointing.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Requesting a refund today and sending it back.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"My 2nd fit bit in the last few years, Ist one band fell apart and they would not replace the unit with out jumping though hoops to get it done.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Would not simply exchange the product.,7,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"Now my blaze will no stay sync'd with my phone, even after trying to sync manually, it will not connect and say connected.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,Looked at my watch today and it is telling me the wrong time.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,Looked at my phone and it has not sync'd in over two weeks and still cannot manually connect it.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,"Find another product, especially at the $180.00 price tag they are asking for.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I will preface this by saying I am returning the Fitbit Blaze but not due to any problems!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I've had the Fitbit one for 3 years now and finally decided I deserved an upgrade!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I wanted one that would double up as a watch and get notifications from my phone so the blaze seemed like the perfect fit.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have M/L wrists so I thought it would be fine.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The reason I decided to return it was it's just a little too big for my taste so I'm going to go with the Charge HR2.,"1,4,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"With all of that being said, the blaze itself is awesome!",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love getting the notifications from my phone so I feel like I can walk away for it for long periods of time but not miss anything important.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I really love that it also measures your heart rate and you can adjust your settings to whatever workout you are doing.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,If you don't mind a really big watch then this is a great choice!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Ordered this for my husband because I love mine so much.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I also ordered the Weight Guru scale to sync with our Fitbit app.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,So glad I did!!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Between the watch and scale we're sure to keep our health in check at 73.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Updated: I finally got in touch with a customer support person.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Review went from 1 star to 3 stars only because they went out of their way to make things right and offered a one time out of warranty replacement.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This does not change the track record of unreliability for Fitbit trackers.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Original review: ?So sad!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,In true fassion my #fitbit blaze broke just over the year warranty.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I put this thing through a lot and thought I finally got a good Fitbit.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"But just like always, Fitbit I have last just over a year before something goes wrong.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This time the screen cracked.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Really!?,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,$200 watch worthless.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Contacted @fitbit @FitbitSupport #noresponse ?if you are going to by a Fitbit plan on getting a new one every 13 months or so.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Purchased as a requested Christmas Gift and while the family member it was for had some repeated syncing and set-up issues the device appears to be working well with minor tech problems here and there.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,and Functional Suitability
B019VM3F2M,3,The battery charger has basically been failing to charge reliably for the last couple of months now and will likely need replacing.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"We had expected an above average to excellent device based on reviews but the Fitbit Blaze Smart Fitness Watch appears to be basically just slightly better than average and now with the failing charger, long term reliability is in question.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I had a Fitbit Charge HR and a Pebble Watch.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I upgraded to the Blaze in order to have everything on one device.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I have been reasonably happy, but there are a few functions that the Pebble performs better than the FitBit.","2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The vibration motor on the Pebble is much stronger than the one on Blaze.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I have a hard time noticing it when I am awake and there is no way the Blaze vibration alarm would wake me up.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The notifications function is not as reliable and full featured as the Pebble was, but that is a software issue that hopefully will be fixed soon.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,and feature request
B019VM3F2M,4,"Bottom line is that when I decided to go to one device, I knew that my choices were a smart watch that has added fitness tracking or a fitness tracker that has added smart watch functionality.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I decided that I thought fitness tracking was more complex and more important to me and went with the Fitbit Blaze.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I am betting that it will be easier for Fitbit to upgrade the smart watch functionality to compete with the Pebble than it will be for Pebble to upgrade to match the Fitbit tracker functionality.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I am happy with the Blaze as my one device choice, but I am anxiously awaiting software updates from Fitbit.","2,3",,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch does work and keeps time correctly.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,The heart rate monitor is great to have for when you're exercising.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The menu controls are not that great and could use some improvement.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,2,I feel that its way over priced at $200.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It should be more like $100.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Cons: Battery keeps getting worse and worse.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,First time charging: 5 days of battery.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Second Charge: 3 days of battery.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch itself feels cheap and doesn't feel like its well made.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The watch should be waterproof like other manufactures of these types of watches.,1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I am really disappointed with the quality and consistency of the heart rate monitoring.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,A little walk with my kids reads as a more strenuous workout than an hour-long crossfit session.,"1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"This very expensive watch is basically a big, unattractive black square on my wrist that vibrates to remind me to walk.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"So, so disappointed",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Not recommended for biking.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Fitbit app requires IPhone Location Services to be 'Always On'.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"If set Location Services to 'While Using App', it will not track your bike ride.",2,,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,5,This fitness watch does so many awesome things.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I probably could have bought one of the cheaper ones, but because I have a large wrist, I needed a wide band.","1,4",O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I wish I wasn't so lazy and would use this monitoring system to its full capabilities and get fit.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Fit Star is suburb!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The warm up exercises are great.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,So much better than an apple watch to me.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Being able to work out with other people around the world, and in your own back yard is a great way to meet work out buddies for motivation to stay fit.",3,,,

B019VM3F2M,5,This is exactly what I needed.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Thanks Fitbit!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Don't buy it if you plan to use it with Android, syncing is almost impossible, several pairings needed per day.",2,,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,2,does not track without phone.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,"phone pairing will stop during exercise, is really bad.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Does not give a warning if you are not active like other trackers.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,UPDATE: After checking the competition I would have never bought this watch.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Way too dependent on the phone.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,the sync with the phone is just really bad.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"if i could after 3 months with it, I would return it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I purchased this to replace a FitBit Charge 2 that stopped working after a year.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,When researching a replacement tracker what I liked most about this one was the ability of changing out the bands for variety.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Unfortunately the band that came with the item must have been faulty, one of the latches that allow the removal of the band kept coming undone.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Before I could change out the band I looked down to see the time and it was gone!,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It was very disappointing to loose something within 3 weeks of owning it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Last time,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I have been a fan of Fitbit for years; I've always loved their products.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,When my Charge HR died for the last time my husband convinced me to try a Garmin.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I did, ended up disliking it and returned it to purchase the Blaze instead.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I loved being back to Fitbit with all the options I loved.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I have owned the Blaze for less than two months and if I do not charge it fully, every single night, the battery is dead by 5pm the next day.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The battery lasted longer in the beginning but never more than 3 days.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,My husbands Garmin lasts almost a full week before he needs to charge it.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I guess it is time to try another product.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,So far lots of fun.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It seems to take some experimenting on getting data from apps to sync cohesively.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"For Example: if I am biking, I use both the Fitbit and Map My Ride app I get all of the metrics collectively, so the fitbit says I burned 2x calories, biked for 2x time and so on.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,I would prefer it to know that I couldn't be riding 2 different bikes at the same time.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,I also find a large discrepancy in the mileage and calorie burn.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If I use just the Map My Ride app the fitbit gives me metrics for having climbed multiple stories, due to the elevation rises on my bike ride presumably.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I use the My Fitness pal app as well and it again takes the metrics and combines them collectively, I would like to see a setting to choose which one I want to use data from.",2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,"It looks good, light weight, screen is easy to see and use.","1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,it seems that it was released before it should have been because the fitbit instructions suck and most of the functions I have discovered have come from google searches.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I had to purchase this for a fitness course that I took in high school.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I don't have the rash problem that so many people were talking about on here, however I made sure not to wear it while it was wet or while I was wet, so that may have something to do with that.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like the call and text features, but I hardly use them.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,My grandma on the other hand uses them all of the time.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,My absolute favorite feature (and the only reason I still wear the watch) is the silent alarm.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I've always hated a loud, blaring alarm sound and this alarm feature on this watch wakes me up much happier than the loud alarm on my phone.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,My biggest problem with this watch is the fact that most of the time in order to get it to sync to my phone I have to shut down the watch and turn it back on.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love my Fitbit blaze!!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Great addition to my fitness journey!!,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,5,!,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Seriously this thing needs like 20 x the watch faces it has like 10.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,It holds a charge a decent amount of time.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,But don't expect to charge it on the go unless you remember it's weird charger.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I wish it could just plug into a standard phone charger.,1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It is a good fitness tracker but all its smart watch functions seem dated compared to anything else.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,I ended up going back to my Samsung Gear 2 over this.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I purchased this as a replacement for my Fitbit One and a basic smart watch.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I had to uninstall and reinstall the Fitbit app on my phone to get it to connect the first time, but since then haven't had an issue.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Getting phone notifications took me a while to figure out, as the Blaze showed as connected through Bluetooth but I wasn't getting the notifications.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It was a simple solution (on the Blaze, under settings, Bluetooth classic had to be on then I could find it with my phone) and now notifications and syncing are working great.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,The downsides I've found are in tracking steps.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"If I'm grocery shopping and holding the cart, steps are not tracked.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"However, if I'm driving and have that hand on the bottom part of my steering wheel, steps are tracked.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"On a positive note, the heart rate matched the one on the treadmill (from their sensors) and also on the stationary bike.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The distance for the treadmill was really close, though calorie burn estimates weren't.",1,"P,C",,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Of course, the weight I entered in the treadmill was accurate & I haven't recently updated my weight with Fitbit which could account for at least some of the difference.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love the fitbit.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love seeing messages while at work.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I bought a separate charging station so I don't have to take out the screen to charge it.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Definitely don't leave it charging longer than it needs because it will kill the battery.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I love working out and knowing how efficient I'm being.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The new sleep feature that they released even tells you your sleep cycles so you can track how much rest you're getting.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,This is an upgrade for me and I love it!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I didn't find it difficult at all to learn how to charge it, set it up and use it.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,If you actually READ the instructions you will not have any issues.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I think some of the reviews are a little misleading in that regard.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The wrist band is comfortable for me, I don't notice it.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,What I liked most is that it transferred my old data so it's like I didn't miss a beat.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I also like that it is is a truly customized device for you.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I almost returned this watch because it took nearly two days to charge it.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Instructions that came with the watch were useless, since they only directed me to go to the Fitbit website.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Once online, I could only read how to use it by setting up an account.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,You can only set up the account by allowing it to update the device first.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,You can only update the device after it has been charged.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The charging apparatus was not exactly intuitive and I could not get detailed instructions without setting up the account, which couldn't be set up until the device had been charged.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,This was very discouraging when the watch took nearly two days to charge.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Once the unit was charged and I was free to move about the Fitbit website, things started to make more sense and now I actually like it better than my traditional watch, except that I would prefer a gold trim, instead of silver, to match my wedding ring.","1,3,4",C,,

B019VM3F2M,2,"To me, it failed to function as a smart watch.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Therefore,  it was just am overpriced fitness tracker.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,You can get other fitness trackers that do more (like built in GPS) for less.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"At first I loved using this, it was cool and easy to wear and had awesome features, but ultimately I returned it because I noticed the HR monitor was completely off whenever I was doing physical activity.","1,2,3",C,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,At home or just on a slow (I do mean slow) walk it seemed accurate (I eventually compared it by taking my own HR and by using two other HR monitors) but for fast walking or jogging or running it was substantially underestimating my heart rate.,1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,4,I purchased this somewhat hesitantly after reading reviews about the mysterious pain and tingling from some users.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I charged it for about 4 hours before wearing to make sure that it was at 100%.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"When I first put it on, I'll admit I did feel something like tingling numbness, or possibly even a TENS unit.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The pain stayed local to the area around the watch for maybe half a day, and then faded into kind of an ache that also presented in my shoulder.",1,C,,

B019VM3F2M,2,This is a nice fitness tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I would give it five stars except for the battery life.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It barely lasts  three days and than it takes two to three  hours to charge.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I would not buy this product again.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I bought my wife a TomTom Surge with cardio and music.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,The battery life on the TomTom is 10 days.,"1,5",O,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It does everything this Fitbit Blaze does.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I have enjoyed owning the Fitbit Blaze for the past few months but have become increasingly frustrated with the optical heart rate monitor.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"If you are looking for an accurate heart rate monitor, avoid the Fitbit Blaze.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I am not asking for exact accuracy.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,My expectation is that the HR monitor is within 10 - 15 bmp.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"However, the Fitbit Blaze will consistently be off more that 40 bmp, especially when I am doing high intensity workouts.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"I have tested this product against an old HR chest strap that I used to have and various machines in the gym (bike, elliptical, etc.)",5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,and the Fitbit Blaze is constantly showing a heart rate of 40 - 60 bmp less than my actual heart rate.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"When on a cardio machine, the Fitbit Blaze will catch up to my actual heart rate after a few minutes, but my expectation is that it lags by a few seconds, not minutes.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Other than having no faith in the heart rate monitor, I do enjoy using the Fitbit Blaze and I still wear it every day.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,this is SLICK!!!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,so comfortable to wear and sync's with phone quickly and frequently.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,LOVE the display and big numbers for my old eyes!,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"So what it doesn't have GPS, what do you need a map of your run for anyway?",1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"IF you do need a map, it syncs with phone GPS easily enough.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love the little exercises and great sleep tracking.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The website is very user friendly and easy to navigate.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Had a garmin 235  and it would always lose connection with phone and wouldn't sync.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Could this be any better!?!!?,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,NO!!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,!,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Won't stay paird with my phone.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Every time someone calls I check the watch to see who's calling only to find out that it's no longer paird.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Keeps track of all my biometrics just fine.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Fitbit states this works with Samsung S8, but it does not.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,"Worked fine with my previous phone, so I know it's not operator error.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I got my Fitbit Blaze working with a little trouble and a lot of technical help from Fitbit, but not much more than usual, given my modest status in the tech world.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The Fitbit Blaze has  an amazing range of possibilities for the keep fit/keep healthy enthusiast but the key thing is to be sure, before you make the purchase, that you really want that much technology or are you actually just looking for a watch with some wrinkles, because the price is high (around $180).","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"What bothers me increasingly is that there is also a considerable loss of your privacy if you set up the Fitbit to its full capability, because you have to enable the Fitbit to communicate the data it collects on you ('sync' it) to your account and your account can be accessed by Fitbit.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I personally have concluded that I don't need all this technology but that was my mistake not Fitbit's, which is a very helpful company, its technical support is excellent and its online manual first-class.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Cannot get it to sync with my iPhone.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,The heart rate monitor has a light that makes it hard to wear at night (for sleep monitoring).,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Clunky to wear.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Works well, and some of the features are cool but the heart rate monitor stopped working after 1.5 years and fitbits response was basically, 'More than 365 days than when you bought it?","1,2,4","C,P",Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Tough luck, here's a link to buy a new one.'",8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,This product is great.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"it does one important thing in my opinion, and that is that it keeps you active.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,because of this watch i am self-conscious of when i am being lazy on an specific day.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,to ear extra step i park further away when every i go out.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,i have walked around the neighborhood for hours listening to music because i was behind on my steps for the day.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,two things that i do not like that might be a deal breaker for some people are 1 - that it cannot be submerge as per the review that i have seen on you tube.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,so no showering or swimming with it.,"1,6",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"2 - the charging device feels like it might break easily, thankfully they have a lot of option in amazon for replacements.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,my review of a good product is this.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"if it breaks, i will buy it again.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like it, does exactly what it is supposed to as far as track my fitness.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Love the iphone app it syncs with, and LOVE the feature it has that alerts me of phone features, texts, calls, alarms.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The thing I really dislike, and mentioned by hundreds of others...the unpredictability of the 'watch' to actually function when I turn my wrist.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,It works maybe 3 out of 5 times.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Not positive but I think the longer its asleep, that is when it doesn't like to 'wake up'.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"For that reason alone, it only gets a 3 and I render the price tag way out of its league",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"1st one worked great for about a week, then a charge would only last for 4 hours, replacement from Amazon did not work at all so I called Fitbit and they sent a 3rd one.","1,7",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It will not connect to my Samsung S8 but did initially work with my Samsung Note 5.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Call to and a trip to the Sprint store did not fix the bluetooth connectivity issues!,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have had 4 different Fitbits and by far the least productive due to these issues.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Either Fitbit or Samsung need to correct this!,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I've had my blaze for over a year and the first year it worked great!,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,No complaints then.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,After a year the thing gets wonky and the charger connections need attention.,"1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,If I didn't know any electrical engineers it would have died long ago.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Also it is now randomly shutting off for no reason.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Has plenty of battery power and just have to hit any button to turn it back on and connect back to the Bluetooth.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have been unable find anything that specifically happens to make it turn itself off.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,After buying three fitbit HR's this one seems like it will actually be around for a while.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"My problem with the HR's was always band related, this is easily remedied in this product, with a quick switch.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love the features on this too,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Unfortunately the first watch that arrived was defective and after only wearing for a couple of days the battery died and would not charge.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Fortunately I called FitBit and explained the issue and they immediately sent a replacement.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The process while annoying since I wanted to begin using the FitBit immediately is why I am giving 4 starts.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Ever since receiving the replacement I have been enjoying getting to know and use the tracking capabilities on the FitBit.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I also like how this model looks.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,It works well and looks good.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Love this!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I went from a surge to the blaze.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The blaze is super lightweight compared to the surge.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love all the accessories you can purchase and the colored display.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It also has a lot of clock options and you can set alarms from the fitbit rather than having to do it from the fitbit app.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,If you are a person with an active lifestyle you will probably like this tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,If you have a very sedentary job and want to use it to remind you to move more do not waste your money.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It is also one of the worst sleep trackers I have ever seen.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,It logs me as asleep when I am awake and moving.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,The calorie tracker works only moderately well when paired with My Fitness Pal even though it is a recommended compatible app.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2,I would be better off going back to wearing both a watch and a less expensive tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Overall I am pretty happy with this product.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I would like to see more time screen display options and it would have been nice if this product was waterproof like the my pebble Steel.,"1,2",R,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The product is water resistant but it would have been nice where to be waterproof, also it would have been better if they would have had a magnetic charger like the Pebbles do instead of having to take the center device out and put it in a charging cradle every time",1,R,,
B019VM3F2M,2,It worked amazing for a little under a year and now it won't keep change for more than a couple hours...,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Time on this thing hasn't worked for more than a day since it got it.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"The interface works most of the time, sometimes I can't get to anything but notifications and the clock.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I feel like I wasted money and coulda got something cheaper.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Takes forever to update too.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like all the features the Blaze offers, but it has some operating issues.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,My main problem with my Blaze is that it keeps losing its connection with the app and does not sync.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have to delete it and add it back or turn my phone off and back on.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Inhad this problem in the beginning and it seemed to finally resolve itself.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"After the last system upgrade, it started happening again several times each day.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If I had known there would be all the connection problems, I would not have purchased the Blaze and continued using mybOne.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I like it, but I do not like that you can only get the Fitstar Ab workout on your watch.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,The rest of the workouts have to be viewed from the computer which defeats the whole purpose.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"It counts stairs accurately most of the time, and the steps seem to be accurate as well.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Not very aesthetically pleasing, but I guess its not meant to be a fashion statement.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,a bit disappointed.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I upgraded from a Fitbit HR (which died on me after six months for unknown reasons), my husband still wears his with no problems... the Blaze face is much bigger, which I expected, but not enough features to make that irrelevant.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,The battery lasted a few days before needing recharging when I first started wearing it.,1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Now it will only last one day before needing recharging, regardless of how much I'm using it.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I've turned off the notifications and such.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Maybe I just have bad luck with these things.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,:-( I enjoyed the clock on the face and the pulse/steps/calories burned features.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Everyone thinks it's an Apple IWatch.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I wanted to love this watch and for the first few weeks I did.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,However it has a major flaw.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The connected GPS is not accurate.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I mountain bike.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The other night I went on a ride that I know has over 1200 feet of elevation gain and is over a 9 mile ride.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,At the end of the ride I checked my Fitbit and it shows elevation gain of 320 feet and only 4.5 miles.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,So it makes it pretty much useless.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Another pet peeve is what's the point of the new update that allows you set set your goal to move through out the day but it doesn't have an actual notification to remind you?,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,The app tells you if you moved enough during that time but it doesn't actually remind you to move.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Really like the tracking capabilities of the Fitbit Blaze, heart rate, steps, stairs and sleep to name a few.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"It's a sharp looking watch, I also purchased a silver wrist band to go with the black.","1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The battery isn't the longest lasting, this lasts for about three days, but the charging of the device is simple, poop it out of the wrist band and into the charger, charge complete within a couple of hours.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"The only real complaint that I have, besides the relatively short battery life ( I have had a Fibit Charge and a Pebble, both have charges lasting about five days) is the watches notice/alarm vibration.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"This device, when compared to my two previous devices, has a vibration that does the job but can be easily missed if you're preoccupied.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"You knew when the alarms/vibration on my previous devices were going off, this one is not as noticeable.","1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Still a very nice device.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I would recommend its purchase.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Functionally, I like the Blaze: it has longer battery life than prior models, it tracks a variety of exercises, heart rate, and sleep very nicely.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,But one big flaw costs it a star or two: the vibration alert I liked so much on my Charge HR model is virtually gone.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"It DOES have a vibration, but it's barely discernible.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"If you're exercising or in a public place, there's very little chance you'll feel or hear the alert about various notifications, and you may not be woken up by its vibrating alarm.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,3,i find this extremely disappointing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I'm not going to return it because I like its look and its general operation, but I'll be wearing by old Charge HR to bed so I can be sure to wake up.","1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,Disappointing that Fitbit did not manage to design this correctly.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Initially the watch was great.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"3 months later it doesn't hold a charge for more than 30 hours and that is without using bluetooth, music, etc.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Very unfortunate that I invested so much money (also bought an additional leather band) and it lasted less than 3 months.,"1,3,4",O,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"First of all, love this Fitbit.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I wear it every day almost all day.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Positives: -tells you where to improve -helps you reach your goals -comfterble -it looks nice Cons: -the metal scratches VERY easy.,"1,2","C,P",Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,-it is not waterproof -dust and dirt shows very easy.,1,"C,P",,
B019VM3F2M,4,-seems just a bit inaccurate.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Overall, I do love this Fitbit and would choose this one over any of the others.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Love the Fitbit Blaze, the only thing I would change is the watchband, it makes me sweaty.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,One huge benefit is the stopwatch; since I am a nurse this comes in very handy.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,There are so many features...one of which is weight loss if you use this correctly!!,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,!,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I decided that with my tax returns I would do something healthy for myself, and decided that upgrading from the flex to the blaze was the best thing to do.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was a little hesitant to do so because the difference in the sizes made me think that I would regret just how big the blaze was compared to the flex that I would never be able to get use to it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I did.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Instantly.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,And I am absolutely in love with it!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I love the color screen, and how you can change the clock face settings to show how active you have been minute to minute.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The floors are accurate and I absolutly LOVE being able to see how many steps I have just by looking at my wrist.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The fact that they have small workouts to get the blood pumping a swipe away is perfect, especially since it teaches you how to do each move.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You are able to switch out the watch bands (something that swayed me to the flex) possible negatives: Checking texts is pretty awesome, but I wish that it was a little more interactive.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,Even if it means that you can just open up a larger text message to view all of it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The heart rate moniter seems to be a little high, even when I move the blaze up my wrist, as instructed by fitbit, it is not getting near what Im actually reading for my resting heart rate I wish there was a way to set a reminder that would go off if you are too sedentary, so that it pushes you more to move.",1,"C,R",,
B019VM3F2M,5,This tool has helped me retrain my body and my lifestyle into something a lot more healthy.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"With the meal tracking, I taught myself what 1700-2000 calories a day looks like with healthy foods compared to bad ones.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,I now know I wasn't walking nearly as much as I previously thought.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I know my sleep is pretty lousy and needs improving.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,All these pieces of knowledge are keys to getting healthy.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Only issue I've had so far is with the stair stepping count being incorrect.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"Drove from Nashville, TN to MS and it said I climbed 100 flights of stairs.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I know it's not 100% accurate, but is a great tool for weight loss.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The battery lasts me about 2-3 days on a full charge, so it's pretty nice there also.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I bought this product because it said it was new, but come to find out, it was refurbished.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I was the second owner.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"First bought in July 2016, fixed in Jan 2017 and sold to me.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Giving 3 stars because this product was owned before.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,"Other than getting a refurbished Fitbit, this thing got me more motivated to workout.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I can tell when my anxiety is kicking in (due to ptsd) because my heart rate will rise.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Before this I counldnt tell until i was having chest pains.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Loved it.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,Feel naked without it.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I've used this watch continuously since I bought it two months ago.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Durability: The battery lasts for several days, long enough that it isn't a nuisance to take it off and charge it.",1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Reliability: I've used it in several cases where I knew my heart rate was over 150 and it registered as below 135.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Otherwise, it seems accurate.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Comfort: It feels like any other watch.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,No discomfort when worn regularly for extended periods.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I only take it off to shower and recharge.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Features: I mainly use it for monitoring heart rate, but I bought it specifically to record my sleep habits.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The record of minutes and number of times restless and awake at night help me know if I need to change something in my habits.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Overall: I think this watch would be excellent if it worked for high-intensity exercise with peak heart rate levels.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4,Enjoying it alot.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Using it to connect with other friends trying to move more.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The heart rate monitor is really helpful for me which is why I went with this model.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I saw someone else wearing it who showed me the extra features and since I do not normally wear a watch most folks don't know it is a fitbit at first look.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,One thing I recommend for any of the fit bits is to go into settings and choose your own step goal.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The application defaults to 10K steps which for me is about 4 miles.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I know a bunch of folks that stopped using theirs because they got discouraged by the 10k.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Set your own goal and you may be much happier with the product long term.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I put mine at 5K and find it is just enough to get me out for a walk at night to finish off the goal.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I wanted a smatwatch that had a heartrate monitor, sleep tracking and would not need to be charged every day.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,This one fits the bill.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Notifications are still a little off sometimes and do not come in right away.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Over all it's a good smartwatch for the price and what it does.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"When I first got it in March, from time to time it would not connect to my Bluetooth.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Then it would happen more frequently and I usually was able to fix it myself.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,"Now, for over a week I have not been able to connect it.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,I just use it as a watch now.,"4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,1,Can't use any of the features I bought the damn thing for.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,1,I've tried every trouble shooting thing possible and nothing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,1,I should've returned it at the first sign of flaw.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I went on a whim to purchase this for myself so far I'm very pleased with the whole product I'm able to work in it without it getting in the way.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It did cause a rash on my arm after prolonged wear so now I switch it back and forth day to day till my wrist is used to it.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,(Same thing used to happen with watches) over all very happy it has definitely helped me try to be more active and the app helps me track my eating sleeping water intake habits as well.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Very happy and you will be to or my name isnt Bobdole,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I had a Surge but got tired of the constant rash despite following the fitbit 'skin care' guide, so decided to try out the Blaze.","4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I like it much better than the Surge, but apparently fitbit didn't learn their lesson from the many many complaining users and appear to have used the same band material.","1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I switched over to an off brand leather band which I love.,"4,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"While I think the Blaze is a 5 star, knocking a star off as a product that costs this much and has had so many complaints should have a band that doesn't cause so many skin issues.","1,3",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I am really not sure who the fitbit dermatologists are, but maybe a new group needs to be consulted.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,3,It is a good product but there are some issues syncing  with the iphone.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have a surge with no issues.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,But the blaze?,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,just don't know.,8,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Good watch and exercise tracker.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Notifications does not function very well with my apple 5.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Reboot gets it going but then when phone out of range it quits again.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,Restart will get it going again.,6,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,No where near the functions of the Apple Watch but no where near the price either,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,This little watch has helped me to lose some weight and has made me much more mindful to get up and get exercise.,"3,4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I have also used their calorie tracking app to keep track of how much I've consumed vs. burned.,"4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I'm not Mr. Triathlon and don't even go to the gym, but this watch definitely has helped me to pay more attention to my health and keeping moving with walks and exercise during the day.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,It is great for people like me that work from home and may not always be mindful to get up and simply move around more.,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Thanks folks!,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"As far as fitness trackers go, I find the Fitbit Blaze to be both functional and stylish.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"In addition to acting as a pedometer, it also will take phone and text notifications and has a heart rate monitor that helps track calories burned and heart rate.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,I find it interesting to see what my heart rate during different times of the day and it's superior to the Alta in recognizing workouts.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,"From reviews I've read, the HR monitor is fairly accurate though your mileage may vary and I do not take it as gospel.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,The major drawbacks that I've noticed so far are that my right wrist keeps getting a rash.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"My left wrist does not react in the same way, so I'm not sure what's going on.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"Additionally, I find the sleep tracker a bit inaccurate since when I feel I sleep better it says I've slept worse.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,I sometimes have insomnia and it doesn't recognize the time I'm lying in bed trying to fall back asleep as my being awake.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4,"But as a way to move more and track activity, I do recommend the Blaze.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I love Fitbit.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I started with a Charge HR and it is a great starter activity tracker.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,There was one big problem I had with the Charge HR.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The distance I walked didn't show up on the display when I turned up my wrist.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,It didn't matter how I set up the display I still had to press the button to see the distance.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,5,On the Blaze the distance and time show up on the Exercise screen that displays when you flip up your wrist.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Blaze also seems to be more accurate on reporting distance walked even indoors.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,The band is very comfortable and the entire device is lightweight.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I was a little worried that it would be too large for my wrist but it fits perfectly and is actually more comfortable than the Charge HR.,"1,5",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The Blaze lays flatter so it doesn't get caught up on cuffs of my shirt making it much more clothing friendly.Overall I am very satisfied with the Blaze.,"1,3",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Bought this for my wife for our anniversary.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Helps her to focus in on where her workouts are or are not efficient.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"The sleep monitoring function has been very telling, as she has discovered that her 'restful' periods are not as they should be, and is allowing her to seek advice in order to improve her sleep.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,Had one small glitch with it months kitchen when some water got on the sensors.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5,The screen kept flashing on and off rapidly.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5,Quickly found the reset sequence via Google and have been glitch free for several months,"3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I love my Blaze, it's so cute and functional.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I had a Charge HR before, and I love this one way more.","3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,5,I like the customization available with the watch face.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"You can change it to digital clock if you want, which I find very convenient.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"It's easier to start/stop workouts by swiping left and selecting workout on the touch screen, which is easier than remembering which combination of buttons to push on the HR.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I bought a stand charger which makes charging it a lot less hassle, you don't have to take it out of the band if you purchase the stand charger rather than the charger it comes with, makes life easier.","1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,5,"I bought my mom and dad Blaze's for Christmas and they LOVE them, they also love the fitbit app and the ability to be friends on the app and challenging and encouraging everyone.","2,3,4",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5,It's an awesome device.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,PROS:A watch with some interchangeable apps.,2,,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,4,I get excited to see the steps go up throughout the day and find myself more aware of my hourly movements.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Clean lines and bold style - I can wear it with anything in my closet and look forward to getting a leather band for it.,"1,4",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4,CONS: I don't 'love' it because it can't get wet like a standard athletic watch.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Chasing a toddler around - I could use a little more durability.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"And as a deep sleeper, I don't feel the vibrations as a morning alarm, I wish it had a chime feature or a stronger vibration.",1,"C,R",,
B019VM3F2M,4,This is a good product which could be great.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Fitbit owners are people who are interested in tracking their fitness regimes.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4,Many of us like to swim and this product is not waterproof; I am not talking about SCUBA but surface swimming such as in a pool.,"1,4",R,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I swim laps for an hour three times a week and cannot track my progress for this period.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,"I like being able to easily track my activities, particularly my heart rate as I am recovering from open heart surgery.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,4,Another reason for my less that top rating is that my Blaze is not as accurate as my Charge; I bought the Blaze to replace the Charge primarily due to its screen.,"1,5",C,,
B019VM3F2M,4,I know Fitbit has recently released Fitbit Flex 2 which is waterproof but it does not have a screen so that one can easily monitor the workout results; therefore I will not buy it.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,Is NOT compatible with Samsung galaxy s8 plus.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Can not receive notifications.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Called Fitbit support and they told me sorry my phone is too new and they don't know when they will update their system to be compatible with the S8 Plus.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,"This is unacceptable to me for the simple fact that I have a new phone so these functions should work, not to mention the fact that they State you can receive notifications.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,2,Nowhere on the product purchase information does it tell you which phones are compatible in which are not.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2,I spent $150 on this and I am very disappointed than I cannot receive text messages or see who is calling,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,I had my Blaze for 9 months.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,I have it paired with my GS7 It worked really well for the first two months.After that my incoming calls wouldn't display anymore.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,"I would reboot the device, disable and enable the feature, I even deleted the and re downloaded the fitbit app.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,3,Which it will work for the first two calls then back to square one.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3,If you are looking for a smart watch just stick to an actual smart watch like the Galaxy Gear or an Apple watch if you have an iPhone.,5,,,
B019VM3F2M,3,The fitness features work well but for that you might as well save some money and just get the Charge HR.,"3,5",,,
