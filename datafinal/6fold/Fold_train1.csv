B01DFKC2SO,3,We have had some issues with the Nest and the Echo Dot not working together when it is supposed to and there are times when it just doesn't recognize commands even though we've don't tons of voice training with the device.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I also find it mildly annoying that you can't just ask a question like,  'Alexa, what sound does a whale make?'",2,,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,4,It's fun though.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Paired easily enough with the Alexa app on my phone and my Bose Soundlink II bluetooth speaker.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Not as comprehensive in it's answers as my Google Home, but it's much easier to ask Alexa to tell Harmony to turn on an activity than it is to say 'Hey Google, tell Harmony to turn on...' in exactly the right inflection to match my initial voice pairing.","2,4,5",,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,4,Or at least my z-wave/zigbee networked house.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,I didn't see the value in it and wasn't too impressed with its audio and picking up voice (had to repeat commands or questions).,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I decided to get the dot since it's cheaper.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The good: its smaller and can use USB power.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Audio is loud enough and can plug into your home audio system, car, Bluetooth speakers.",1,P,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,The 1st one died in 3 months and I did not buy the insurance on it.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I contacted Amazon and they said they'd send me another echo for $49 which I totally balked at.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I told them it didn't make sense for me to spend $49 for another one when the first one didn't even last three months!,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,After much discussion an Amazon customer service supervisor agreed to send me a replacement at no charge.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Kudos to Amazon for standing up for what's right.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I was offered the echo debut price of 99 a long time ago and held out until the 2017 prime day deal on the dot.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The dots speaker is great, I was very surprised actually.",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"For a single room, listening to podcasts, or music even, it beats the portable bluetooth speaker I had been using.",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I would say that if you are thinking you are going to need a bigger speaker, get the dot first before you purchase a speaker to see if the dot alone meets your needs.",1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I will be pairing it with a new speaker because I'd already scored another awesome prime deal, but for other rooms in the future where I would like additional dots, I don't think it's necessary.","1,6",C,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"It drops from the wi-fi a lot,,,, some things such as finding stores is pretty cool and playing music .......... it's ok - nothing super exciting but can be helpful.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I absolutely loved my Echo dot until I realized there is ZERO security and anyone within range can connect their phone to your device via Bluetooth.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I live in the city and countless people are always within range of my device.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"It is pretty neat, but could use a lot of work.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It only uses Bing to search, I ask for it to play a song, it's not in my music library, so it won't play, when normally I can Google or you tube and have it play.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I ask for the weather in my town, but since my internet provider is based out of a town an hour north, it gives me the weather for that town, and I can't set a default for my actual town that I want the weather for.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,That's just a few minor annoyances I have noticed so far.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,Right now we use it for voice activated music and to power some smart devices — so not much.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,I was expecting some type of app or program for the PC to enhance the echo and i got a poorly designed web page based app that is hard to navigate and offers limited interaction with the echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,You can not even make the most out of Amazon music unlimited because the music program does not interact with the Echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,You would think a forward thinking company like Amazon would have the foresight to cover all of its customers options equally.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Amazon if you read this not everyone in the world lives their life dictated by an expensive cell phone that is basically a under powered small computer.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Echo is a home entertainment device not a portable speaker that should require a cell phone.,"1,2",O,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,5,My gripes with the system are that I seem to have to switch back and forth between the mobile Alexa app on my FIre and my PC based one account management options depending on what I want to manage or setup--this is likely a user issue and not a system issue.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,4,I would buy this again.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,"Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.","1,4",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Other than that failure, I've loved having it!",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"The only thing that might annoy someone is that if you say anything with the word 'Alexa' in it, then it responds.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Trying to tell someone about it while on the phone necessitated leaving the room when 'she' took off talking!,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It was quite funny & in time I'm sure we'll remember to not do that & how to use it more effectively.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I like the random info it gives & while we intended to use it mainly as a clock/radio, we regularly ask for a joke, put together shopping lists, to-do lists & set timers.",2,,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"But in the meantime, we're having a blast with 'Alexa'!",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,was not very good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Had trouble to get it to work and it still is not very good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,If I had to rate in on a scale of 1 to 9 and 9+ being to best  I would give it a 3.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,You know all of the other things you can do with the Dot/Echo so I won't run them all down.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I was surprised that with the Dot, you still have a small speaker it is sufficient to hear Alexa's responses to your queries.",1,C,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"I've found that using it for anything else is more work than it's worth, at least for me.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's about 90% reliable so I have reasonable confidence that it'll do what I want.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Anthropomorphizing machines to make them more personal is an annoying trend.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"Most of the time, it does what it's suppose to without overdoing the embellishments of simulated conversation.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I have an Echo dot positioned near my computer where I watch videos and listen to music so there are a lot of false triggers.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Most of the time it just turns on and beeps off but sometimes it talks back saying it doesn't understand.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I wish it would just turn off instead of saying something.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's great for what it is.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,A cheap entry level solution into a 'home assistant' or whatever you want to call it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My recommendation is to hook it up to another speaker so the sound quality is better, as it is a truly terrible speaker that's built in - I'm sure as a reason to buy their more expensive models.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Seems to work good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My only real complaint is that it has a few false positives, sometimes responding to the TV if audio says anything remotely close to 'alexa'.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Granted you can change the trigger word to something else, but it's just worth noting.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Definitely not as flexible as Google home in terms of responding.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Quit working after 3 days of use.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"If you're thinking about whether getting this or Google home, I suggest you getting the later.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Google home has much better potential then Alexa, and doesn't look cheap","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"This is overall a good, quality product.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We use it almost exclusively for alarms and playing music off of spotify playlists.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"If you have the volume cranked, she may have trouble hearing, but this is typically not an issue.","1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Pros: Great alarm clock/timer Plays spotify playlists easy for the kids to use Shopping list is nice Cons: Skills are not quite smart enough yet Siri has more answers for things Ecobee control is not intuitive (as are most specialized skills) I would definitely buy this again, and I am thinking about getting more for the house.","2,4",,Information Giving,Define both pros and cons
B01DFKC2SO,4,The convenience factor is way up there and it looks great.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Used it often when first set up for 'specifically requested music.',"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Of late, haven't used it as much because of switching to DirecTV and listening to its music channels.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Granddaughter loves the Echo Dot for her favorite music and to answer her questions.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Probably would use it much more if it was connect to other devices and systems in the house.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But if you are concerned with 'privacy' you may not want a device in your home that listens to audio in the room and tracks what is being said.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Funny how many of those with 'privacy' concerns post their entire life on Facebook for the world to see.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Great price for a cool gadget.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Has limitations though.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Can't answer detailed questions but knows the basics.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Also, it's annoying when Alexa responds even when it hears it's name from the tv or on a youtube video you may be watching.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Plus it will only play songs you've purchased or have uploaded into your library.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,At $40 though you should have one on every level of your home.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's a great alarm clock and reminder.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Worth it!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Sounds like a tin can, terrible compared to the Echo, I regret purchasing it.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Just placed an order for another Echo to replace the DOT.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The DOT will probably be a gift to someone I do not like very much.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Sound is not great for music, perhaps the Echo itself is better.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You also cannot sync and voice command with your iTunes library on your phone, only Amazon Music, Pandora, SIRUS XM, and a few others.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It got on a Prime Day deal, so i guess the $35 was worth it, but i wouldn't have been happy if i paid more for it.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I'll rate again at a later date as i've only used a few weeks and haven't ordered from it yet, only asked weather, and controlled music.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I purchased this in July (2017).,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It is now September and my Echo is now malfunctioning.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I can give it a command to play my music, but after that I cannot give other commands and I am told by the device to try later.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Within 20 minutes, it stops playing my downloaded music.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Any attempts to rectify the problem is met with a swirling red light and advises me to try later.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I have tried to reset it with negative results.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Sound is ridiculously low but Alexa is very smart,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Here's the basics.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use.,1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Not for every day use.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"We don't shop that often, so the usefulness of this device is limited to a voice activated radio, a trivia game, a hard of hearing person who you have to repeat your question to just for the answer to be incorrect.","2,4,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"The dot was a deal, but I would wait until Amazon has better programming for Alexa, or buy a Google home.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Horrible and useless after initial novelty wears off  Has not acquired any new funtions or learned from use.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Another great product from Amazon.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The only downer is the speaker doesn't pick up from more than a few feet away but I didn't buy it for a large room so it's perfect for what I wanted it for.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Update:  I'd really love it if Amazon would allow multiple devices to stream their music, because this can't happen I will not buy another Dot or even an echo.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Which is too bad because I had plans on buying one for each of our kids in their rooms since they love to listen to Amazon music.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I love my echo dot - it's a great price point, inexpensive enough that I don't feel guilty buying it.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I use it the most for time, timers, stopwatch, weather, shopping list, music and to find my phone.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bad move Amazon.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If (when) google voice provides an entry price point for their Google Home line, the only advantage Alexa will have is ordering off Amazon.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,OK ~ I give up!!!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,can not get it to work.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,we have the full-size echo and hooked it up just fine and enjoy it.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"this dot, however -- cannot get it connected.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,i'm not the most tech savvy... therefore enlisted my brother-in-law AND son on different occasions... and neither could get it connected.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,any suggestions will be appreciated.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"otherwise, going to return.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,thanks ~,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I ordered this in January and have enjoyed listening to news each morning.,"2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"After 4 months, it started re-starting randomly during play.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Now, at less than five months, it won't respond.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I have tried unplugging it, then re-plugging it back in.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It starts up, says Hello.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"When I start a request, the blue light comes on, but turns off after about 1 second, before I can complete my request.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I am disappointed that it started with problems at 4 months, and now doesn't work at all.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I bought the Dot thinking I'd be able to play music from the Dot through my Denon receiver with Bluetooth.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I erroneously assumed this would pair with the Bluetooth receiver, as my research showed that both have the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and should, therefore, have been compatible.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"However, the Dot would not pair with the receiver.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The guy I talked with in tech support confirmed that they would not pair, and said Amazon should change the description to reflect that a device may support the A2DP profile but still not pair.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"In order to pair my phone with my receiver, I had to enter a pass code into my phone.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The Dot does not have the capability to do that.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bottom line is that the Dot doesn't pair with any of my devices.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I had to do a work around by plugging a stereo mini plug into the headphone jack on the Dot with split RCA plugs on the other end into the audio in jacks on the back of the receiver.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Not exactly ideal, as the Dot has to remain near the receiver.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,My Amazon Echo Dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Gets worse the more it is used.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Even after a hard reset, it works terribly.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Buy Google Home instead.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Grabbed this li'l thing during a sale.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Been wanting one for the bedroom so I wouldn't have to continually haul Alexa to and from the living room whenever I wanted to chill with her.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's certainly convenient in that respect.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Only two things that kinda bum me out about Dot are: a) the sound quality isn't even close to as nice as her big sister, which I suppose is to be expected from a smaller unit, and sounds akin to the quality of my iPhone's built-in speaker.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,b) I can't have both Echo and Echo Dot streaming the same music/media simultaneously.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's gotta be one or the other.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Was really hoping this would work, so that there'd be a seamless stream of music from one room to the next as you walk around the house.","2,6",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Ah well.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Other than those things, we still really dig her.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,She now sits on the nightstand and has since replaced our iPhone alarm clocks to wake us with a better variety of alarms (the Top Gear guys wake up call is my personal fave).,"2,3,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Bought 4 of these speaker isn't loud at all..,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I thought...what could go wrong with a 90 day warranty.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,My unit started to make a buzzing noise when connected to external speakers.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Unit was 7 months old.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Get the warranty extension.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Customer support spend an hour trying to help me until giving up.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Was angry enough with my stupidity for having a 90 day warranty - but the alternatives are not quite there yet.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Could not connect to my wifi waiting for my daughter to help,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Hard to set up: it took more than an hour because the app couldn't coordinate the bluetooth or the wifi, kept crashing or hanging.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After restarting the echo, phone and app multiple times, a google search showed that sometimes some part of android needs to be updated for the Alexa app to work.","2,3,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I didn't have that problem but it still took another 45 minutes to set up.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The alexa app is the worst.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The echo is ok as speakers go, though the bluetooth is frustrating and iffy at best (it once took me an hour to connect my laptop to my Echo because neither the app or the echo could 'find' the computer's bluetooth).",1,"C,P",,
B01DFKC2SO,3,It's also super annoying (and not totally clearly stated) that it's not possible to link Echos (or dots) together.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Why does all of the Amazon stuff stink?,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Fussy, hard to use, finicky.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The gear from the big G just works and is totally drama free.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Quite straightforward - gives me news and music when I ask.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Sometimes it overhears conversations not intended for her ears.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"For example we were talking about dialling 911 in an adjoining room, and Alexa, taking this as an order, started to do so without being asked!!","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,There should be a cross check by Alexa saying 'Do you really want me to dial 911?'.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,That would only add a couple of seconds to the response time.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Matthew,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"lots of bugs, glitches and problems that the company cant seem to keep up with.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"lots of developers experimenting on the skill market without trying the skills, effectiveness first.","2,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I got this and the Google Home when they just came out.,"4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I keep the Echo at my parent's house and the Home at my apartment, and use both with smart plugs, smart lighting, Logitech Harmony, Nest, Bose Soundtouch, etc.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After a few months, I can say with certainty I absolutely prefer the Google Home, and think the extra money spent is worth it.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"PROS: - LOTS of skills, including the TP Link smart devices, which work well - Asks for voice feedback and has voice training to ensure it understands you - Can work with an awesome speaker, like Bose or Sonos -AllRecipes integration, though should work better CONS: - Voice recognition isn't there yet - everyone in my family gets mad at Alexa.","1,2",P,Information Giving,and Human Usability
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You  say 'Turn lights on'  and it starts playing Sara Bareilles..... -You have to ask very specific phrases, whereas if you tweak the phrasing in Google Home, it still knows what you're talking about - A lot of the awesome, obscure skills, but even without account integration, you need to enable them and remember their names.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Alexa, ask WineBuddy to''.",8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You need to remember all the specific commands for them to work All in all, for $50 it's good - but I'd recommend waiting for it to improve or trying another device.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it!",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"We also like the 'skills', especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the 'tight pants' song lyrics which is a family favorite.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Overall I am happy with it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Cannot train it to understand my wife's accent.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"She' takes only a little time to get used to, but the set-up did not go well the first time I tried it.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The instructions need to be more definitive on what to do and when.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"That said, the sound quality is absolutely incredible given the very small size (on a solid surface).",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The response is very accurate although I did try to search for a composer who shares a name with a country and western singer so when I said, 'play all by…' I got the wrong person until I specified '…by composer …' I very much like the change of color in the top light ring when she is asked for something.","1,2,4,6",O,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,5,My kids love it to check homework (Alexa is GREAT at math!,"2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"), and play games such as 20 questions.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It is small and non-intrusive with your home decor.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"This purchase is for a Christmas gift - my father quizzes Alexa whenever he is at my house, so this is for him.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I highly recommend Alexa- specifically this small Echo Dot - and a small bluetooth speaker to use it with.,"1,3,5",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"While I have two and an Echo, I would love to exchange them for the Google variant.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Alexa is not good, it is not improving as I'd expected and other than consuming Pandora, TuneIn, and Amazon Prime music I use it to turn on WeMo switches, but that's it, don't expect anything else.","2,5,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,3,UPDATE 2: Sound and operation is better face down.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Bought this product and was not the easiest to set up.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I used it for a week and then tried taking it to a new location and it would never turn all the way on (always acted like it was still 'booting up') so I thought if I took it back to where I originally had it that I would work..,"2,4,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I was wrong.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"However, this product was very useful while it worked.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I'm happy enough with the product, but Amazon lost two stars because they made too many assumptions.","3,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I had purchased this as a gift using Amazon Prime, but it didn't even ship for two days.","4,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Days after giving it to the recipient (already late), I noticed in my Alexa app that the new Echo Dot had automaticallt been registered to my account, but it wasn't intended to be mine!.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After all, it's a voice controlled device so the app isn't needed unless you're making changes like adding a Wemo.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I might not have noticed this for months!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I hope this wasn't the cause for problems he had setting up his Echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,He asked me for help setting it up a full month after I have it to him.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Wonderful little device (alexa, ask for a fart)  This device is full of endless fun and resources.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Out of the box it works wonderfully but as you gradually add in or enable various skills you will find this device to be extremely handy.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy) My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Example: Alexa, whats on my calendar tomorrow?","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Alexa: You have an appointment with the eye doctor at (long pause) 30 pm.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,5,This is my 2nd Echo Dot as my 1st one freaked but I had the warranty so it could be replaced.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I haven't had any issues with this one other than it did come on by itself one night and said it couldn't find the answer to the question I had asked.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The house was quiet and I hadn't said anything so that was a tad freaky.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It made me jump a bit and say a word that is similar to poop when it started talking!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The other thing is there are numerous commercials advertising Alexa now days and if the TV happens to be up loud enough my Echo will come on upon hearing the Alexa name and then it is confused about the question it was asked.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If I can, I quickly place a rag, small pillow or blanket on top of it or try and hit the TV mute button when those commercials start to keep that from happening.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,There are so many different things that can be asked of the Echo and a ton of music to choose from for it to play as well.,2,,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,1,I can't use it in Brazil.,"3,4",,,

B01DFKC2SO,1,Did not like this item....have replaced it with google which I have not put into operation yet.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Most of the questions that I asked Echo were responded to with 'I do not know the answer to that question'.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I would then ask google on my phone and I would get the answer.,"2,4,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It did work properly turning off my lights and giving time and weather....,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bought this for my teen-aged daughter.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"She was very excited, until she found out that she needs to purchase monthly services for everything she'd like to do with the device.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I think Amazon needs to be very clear up front that things like music must be purchased and that other features require special set-up which also cost money.,"3,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Also, after I purchased this Dot through Amazon, I saw it on sale at several stores locally for $10 cheaper.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Not happy.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Love my echo bought the dot for my bedroom.,"3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Now I wish I had just gotten another echo for the bedroom.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The dot does not hear me when I'm standing right over it.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Infuriating to get it to work on a basic command.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,My echo works great.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,This dot is just garbage.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Too late to return it.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Guess I'll wait for the regular echo to go on sale and replace it with something that works.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I shouldn't have to yell a wake word at something I'm standing right over.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Disappointing.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Very disappointed in all  three that I've had.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,They lose connection to the internet all the time.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Very very frustrating.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I have excellent internet reception and I even put in an extender to help out and they still lose reception all the time.,"1,4",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,My last one just straight up stopped working and the day it did was the exact day that I couldn't return it anymore.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,That sucked,"4,8",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I bought this for my kitchen because I was curious about whether Alexa is useful or not.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,What a great buy!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"My wife and I had never used Amazon music before, but now we listen to it all the time.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The voice recognition works perfectly, even my 5 year old has no problem using it.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"My wife loves how she can select music, start/stop or change volume with voice commands while she is holding our baby daughter, since she would have no free hand to do it in the phone.","2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Also, Amazon has great lullaby stations!",7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Amazon's Dot comes up short when we're talking about general facts.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Alexa doesn't search the web for relative information as compared to Siri.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I can ask the identical questions to Siri or Alexa only to have Alexa answer 'Sorry I don't know that answer' or 'Sorry I don't understand the question'.,"2,5,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,About the only thing she does well is play and control music selections.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I still have been unable to setup the Echo Dot.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The Iphone App still shows setup page not complete.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"From what I have been able to determine, the 'Home' controls, i.e.",4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,1,"Dot not very useful, will go in a drawer of unused items.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Perhaps we are asking difficult questions that Alexa cannot answer.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But we don't get much out of our questioning.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I guess it just has to be one subject and one verb in the question.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Then last night, when we were in bed at 11:30 pm, Alexa started playing music at a high volume level.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We had to turn off the microphone and unplug it.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The free ebook on the Echo Dot didn't give much explanation on how to talk to Alexa.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"But it's still a fun little item for asking the weather, though it doesn't understand the pronunciation of our city and I have to ask a couple of times.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"We were hoping to use it like the Etymological Dictionary, finding out the origins of words and things.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We'll keep trying.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It is a unique device and I'm sure it will only get getter in time.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Less then 6 months after I got it its not working right it's slow and lagging can't connect to the Internet now I can't return it,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Love this - it's got a lot to learn but it's certainly helpful around the house.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I can ask 'what's the traffic' and she'll tell me how long it's going to take to get to work (pretty close in terms of timing); 'add ____ to the shopping list' - I never forget the list on the counter since it shows up on the app; 'play _____' radio station, Pandora channel, news flash - super helpful.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The speaker is decent, not great, so I just connected it to a Bluetooth speaker and it's perfect.",1,P,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,Decided that it worked so well that it needed and stylish makeover.,"1,3",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,So I secured it on an old radio box and the wooden box make the speakers so much more vibrant and the box I have lets me have all the buttons.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Essentially this is an Alexa listening unit rather than a playback for streaming music.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Even with the ability to pair to a BT speaker, this is not a good alternative to an Echo...","1,3",P,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,A great concept but still very much a work in progress.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The main problem is that it is unreliable as it is plagued by underwhelming voice recognition.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Many times thinks that it is summoned even though there were no words remotely close to its name.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It seems to have gotten worse with time (perhaps after activations increased and the Amazon service is too slow to cope).,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Price is good and the potential is there but the G units are way more accurate.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Well, it does connect to the internet, it does respond to voice control, and it does what it says it's supposed to do.","1,2",P,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"Connectivity is decent, though sometimes playback gets cut off sometimes.",1,"P,C",,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I think that may have more to do with my home bandwidth or something rather than the device functionality.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The Echo Dot is great for smaller rooms like offices, bathrooms or bedrooms.","3,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,You still get all the functionality of Alexa without having a large echo or tap unit as an eye sore in the room.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,You do lose volume with the smaller Dot but in a smaller space it doesn't really make a difference.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,If you buy this make sure to take advantage of the Alaxa newsletter so you get all of the new (they add stuff every week) functionality and apps out of it.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Also take a look at the app wiki so you can activate all the stuff you will actually use.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,This is the second Echo Dot I've purchased after initially getting one to control my entertainment devices in my den.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I've since added some wifi outlets to control lighting and I have a wifi thermostat, so all of them can be controlled from either Alexa (upstairs or downstairs) by whichever one can hear me better.","4,6",,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"The iHome device I paired it with shuts off after a certain amount of time, so that does me no good overnight.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,(not an issue of the echo) Outside of the sound it works great.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I had to figure out why the rings were flashing overnight (it drove me nuts at first)...it means you have a notification.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,2,The speaker is terrible.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Awful.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I can pair it to bluetooth speakers, but then again, I could just pair my phone to the speakers.",1,C,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,Prime music used to be included in your membership.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I don't understand why it's not portable.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I would love to be able to move it from one room to the other to use it as a morning alarm, but it has to stay plugged in in the living room to be of any use to me at all.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It definitely does not do enough to be worth the $50 price tag, particularly when it's stationary and has poor sound quality.","1,3",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If you're just going to use the Dot for podcasts, internet radio, news briefings, weather, home controls, etc., the included speaker in this little unit is fine.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If you listen to a lot of music, the Dot is really intended to use through an external speaker or audio system, via either a male-male headphone cable (not included) or Bluetooth.","5,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,One great use for these is to turn an old clock radio that has an audio-in jack into a voice enabled internet radio and alarm.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I actually think Amazon would do well to release an Echo clock radio, but meanwhile retrofitting one with a Dot also works.",8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I converted two Logitech internet radios this way, and a standard stereo Sony clock radio.",5,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,I use them ALL THE TIME.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"When I discovered all the practical uses for the Echo, I couldn't wait to buy some Dots so I can have Alexa all over the house.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Now I don't have to get up and go to the main Echo to ask or tell Alexa something.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I use these for everything from making lists, setting alarms and timers, asking about the forecast for weather and traffic, playing music, controlling my smart home devices, and much more.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The Dot is a particularly good value for the money; the speakers are a bit tinny sounding but that is overcome if you add an external speaker for better sound quality.,"1,3",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I wholeheartedly recommend the Dot if you just want to try out all the things Alexa can do to help make your life a bit easier.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I have the full sized Echo and love it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Got one of these for the bedroom to play kids music during bath+dress time.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It mostly just wants to play games.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"The bad news is all of the audio comes out of either the Dot speaker OR the AUX out, never both.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,There's no way to have music sent through the AUX jack while Alexa responses like weather and calendar updates come out of the Dot speakers.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,This means you either have to have your stereo on all the time or plug in the Dot for music and then unplug it for general everyday use.,"1,6",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"This isn't a dealbreaker, but it's a pretty aggravating oversight.",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,"Half the time I ask Alexa to play certain music the response is ' I'm having trouble hearing you', whereupon I unplug and replug device and all of a sudden she can hear me.",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,We had not informed anybody that we had an Echo at that time.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"I use it mainly to control the lights in my house, but I know she can do so much more.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I have some problems making it interface w/my Ecobee 3, it most often says it can't perform that function even though it is connected and set up properly, but considering it works fine everywhere else, I'm okay w/that.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Small, non descript, most people don't even notice it even thought it sits right in front of my TV.",1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Very responsive, hears me 95% of the time (and sometimes picks up random things from the TV), even from the other room, and I can talk in a normal voice, not yell (XBOX you need to step up your game, you hardly ever hear me even when I scream at you!)",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Wish it was more interactive with other smart home products (like my receiver so I could change the volume on my sound system), and the shopping list worked better w/OneNote.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Still needs improvement, but I can't imagine going back to life w/out Alexa.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,When we 1st got the dot a few months ago I loved it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Now, I can't keep the dot paired with my Onkyo tx-nr626 speakers, after a few hours off, we have to manually pair them again.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,It is becoming a pain.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,We use this mainly for listening to music.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,If we could fix this we would be happy campers again.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Device I bought three months ago has given up, it's restarting itself again and again, when I do search it restarts, return policy is of very short duration.","2,3,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Not a fan.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It was sporadic at best, glitched many times, and wasn't very adaptive at realizing what I wanted to say.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Plus, there's not really much out there that I'd need this for anyways.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Sure, it's great for setting alarms and telling it to play music on your bluetooth speakers, but these are all things that can be done with your phone and this only provides a TINY convenience factor...when it works.",5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"When it doesn't work, it's frustrating to no end.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"As this product is now, I'd rather be guaranteed my actions work by using a phone and doing things 'the old way'.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Hard to set up.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I have a larger Alexa and the echo dot was for the office.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It has trouble syncing with wifi in multiple places.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I purchased it to ask it questions.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If I see some one on tv or see some reference to some place or some historical event, I like the idea of being to use it as a verbal search engine.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I don't have any interest in ordering things verbally or controlling appliances verbally.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Recently I have been seeing adds on tv for the Google Home.,"4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I looked it up and the reviews state it is much better as a verbal search engine than Echo Dot.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I will purchase one of those.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The Echo Dot doesn't seem to be able to give detailed answers on any of my questions and often says it cannot answer the question.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"According to the reviews, the Google Home is much more capable as an information search engine.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Wasn't given 2nd generation, only the black dot.","5,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Sometimes can't fill the TV request.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Fun to interact with if you ask the right questions.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It is now several days later and I just looked at Alexa and guess what?,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Her sides are white.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"I wasn't paying attention to her sides, just the top.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,We did get the 2nd generation and enjoy playing with her.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bought this to use where my full Echo was having issues connecting to speakers.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"From that perspective, it works well.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"My only complaint, and while it may be 'minor' to some, it is a major inconvenience for the application this was purchase for.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The Dot was working with the remote, but for some reason, it now no longer does.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Going through the configuration app indicates the dot and remote are connected, but it just turns on / off when trying to speak a command.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Well, I am attempting to use the echo Dot with my Harmony Elite and hub.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The integration between these apps is nowhere near functional.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The Alexa app attempts to assign features and control that does not correspond to the harmony software setup.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,In my case I have multiple equipments in multiple rooms and when Alexa attempts to assign functionality it has no relationship to what room associated with what function associated with what equipment.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I am working with Amazon Echo technical support to try and get the app a little more functional by allowing the user to turn off and remove some of these features that do not apply.,"2,4",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I think the designers are overstepping their capability here.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I will update this review after the process is complete.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Returned,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,This device is the infancy stage of a future (as pictured in many a science fiction story) of useful human / computer interaction.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"The limitations are frustrating, but it will come.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,it will come.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Amusing when a TV add says 'Alexa' (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve .",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,..  Ha ha!,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Voice recognition is very good; and I think that was the tough technological nut to crack.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"The rest (improved AI and interfaces) is easier in my opinion, and will progress rapidly.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Must connect with Bluetooth if you need to use the internal speaker as well as connected speakers.,"1,6",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,You need a smart blue tooth receiver that turns on and off with your speakers and automatically reconnects to the dot if you want to avoid always having to connect whether manually or through an Alexa command.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Other than that, brilliant.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Example: most of the time we use Alexa to turn lights on/off.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,No external speakers needed as the internal speaker is sufficient.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"But, when we want music we have to power external speakers and say, Alexa connect Bluetooth if it doesn't issue automatically with the Bluetooth receiver.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,When we're done listening we have to shut off the BT receiver or disconnect the Bluetooth.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Not yet perfect system, but pretty darn cool.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The external speaker management is my only gripe.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The sound is not at all like the Echo.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I am still on the fence if I want to return it and just buy another echo because of the sound quality.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It works for having an 'extension' for your Echo to add things to your list(s), playing your music etc.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"This sucks my phone speaker is better and it has to be plugged in into the wall to beable to to play and the whole reason I got it was because it said I was Bluetooth, I'm sending it back and getting a louder better speaker not from amazon for $20-30 dollars not $49.99 because it was a waist of my money.","3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I'm gonna send it back tonight and get my money back,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"I bought this thinking it would sound as good as the bigger one I have, I ended up returning it, the sound was awful.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Alexa is not as smart as Google Home but she is cheaper and in this size/form it is cheap and easy to use.,"2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The only positive compared to GH is the presence of the audio-Out port.,"1,5",P,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The companion android app is crap though - very slow to start and not very functional.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"And it can't be used to cast video or audio to chromecast, same way amazon video can't be cast.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Amazon is loosing out by not allowing this functionality, since not many people are buying a proprietary fire stick.","1,2",O,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Have been using it for a while now and here are my observations.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The response time for any command for Alexa is quite amazing.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I am not going to repeat all the details of how you can shut of the light , play music blah blah.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But the major drawback I notice is the lack of integration with Google (there is a way to leverage AWS to connect the Dot to google and costs about $5 or so a year based on the requests you make).,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I still have not figured out a way to stop the alarm, (cancel command clears out all the alarms for other days you set up to), and  there is no way for you to select which sound you want to play by talking to Alexa, (it has to be done through the app).",2,,Inquiry,
B01DFKC2SO,4,These are two of the many issues I felt that Amazon needs to address.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Overall a satisfied customer waiting for further improvements down the road.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The Amazon search engine is weak to say the least.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,And Alexa acknowledges commands from male voices better than female.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,We do not use it much but to ask for the current weather conditions.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,We've been using this for 2 scenarios: set-up kitchen timers and read wikipedia for you.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Both works fine, with some understanding issues for complex or long sentences.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Unfortunately it cannot search on youtube and play songs from there, that would be ideal when you have crunky kids around the house with little patience for you to pick-up the phone and do a search by typing, and, then let them hold your phone, that is a dangerous thing in its own.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I never do reviews, but this thing is so life-changing, I just had to do one just to give it 5 stars.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I can't believe I didn't get this sooner.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Would make for an excellent Xmas gift.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The microphone captures commands easily and  set-up was a breeze.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The biggest downside about the dot (and probably all echo devices) is the fact that Alexa uses Bing as its default search engine, which makes for an overabundance of 'hmm, I'm not sure' responses.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I've yet to test out connectivity to smart home devices, which I've read is one of Alexa's strengths, so my rating may change.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"But so far, the dot doesn't serve much more than as a little novelty and entertainment trinket in my home.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Have bought a couple of these!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,They work really well!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I like my full size Alexa better but these are great for bedrooms and such!,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Update one died last night!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Tried all the trouble shooting steps but it still will not find the Internet.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The other one is still working fine but for some reason this one is basically a paperweight now.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Works about as expected.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Occasionally not hearing what was said - or not hearing it properly, and this is after voice training.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"However, voice control is still in its infancy.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Still not entirely natural language, but closer than many prior voice control technologies were just a few years ago (looking at you in particular, Xbox).","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Seems to work well so far with other devices (Wemo outlets and a Harmony Elite), with minor hiccups.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Still needs integration with FireTV boxes.,"2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Google already does this with Google Voice Assistant and Chromecast, so Amazon need to catch up.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,One star off for this.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Still needs work but provides a lot of functionality, once you get past the default marketing concept that underlies the first level of things it can do.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"If you enable the skills you can unlock a lot of useful capabilities, from daily bible reading plans, to turning on appliances with added technologies, playing music from your uploaded library or playing iheart or pandora radio stations.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"There is much still to explore, but answering basic questions is pretty limited and hit or miss as well as reading articles from wikipedia.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Even with skills you have to be pretty precise how you ask for something like play iheart radio station wtvn radio instead of play iheart radio station wtvn 610 radio which never seems to work.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,or ask bible app for daily reading plan instead of play daily reading plan or ask bible app for daily plan.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,And don't believe people about the speaker capabilbiy.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It isn't high quality for playing music but it is fine for reading applications if the room isn't too large.,"1,2,6",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It might not be loud enough for a double room like a kitchen open to a living room area especially if there is a lot ambient noise.,"1,6",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,You would think by now it would be able to answer questions but it doesn't even asked a simple question as what's the number one song out right now and she couldn't even answer it she said I don't know,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"With a smart phone, an iPad, and a laptop, I found no real use for this.","3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Also, with folks talking about their microwave ovens spying on them, I was uncomfortable with always have a continious open ear in the room, often offering unwanted comments or answers to questions not asked.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Returned.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It's  ok for $50 I'm glad I DIDN'T give more than that for it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"It comes on by it's self when u least expect it to, it tells you that it don't know how to help you when you ask it to search for something and it also don't play all of a sermon when you try to listen to one from Ref Net, breaks up a lot when playing or it just stops.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Didn't like this always having to reset so we went with Echo big one and love it,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,So far just meh... Not sure if there is an issue with mine but Alexa hears me ask for things and starts to respond and then just stops and is unresponsive.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,She'll start playing music I ask for and it will play a few words and then stop.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,WiFi signal is strong... Not sure if anyone else is having this issue.,2,,Inquiry,
B01J24C0TI,2,This thing has so much potential but falls quite sure of its promise.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"Several features that should have been easy to make available, but are not there: 1) Using the device's built-in camera/microphone as a security camera (accessible through the app on phone or another echo show device).","1,2",R,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,2,This is not equivalent to a 'Drop In'.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"I want it to be discreet... 2) Direct access to apple music with an app (or 'skill') rather than through me uploading the same music to Amazon cloud, or through bluetooth and iphone 3) Using the device as electronic picture frame with direct access to Photos in Mac OSx.",2,,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,2,And no I dont want to copy all my photos into Amazon cloud!,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,I can go on and on.,8,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"I understand that Amazon and Apple compete in some of these areas, but I am not going to change my entire infrastructure to an Amazon based infra (it is not even possible as there are no equivalents to a Mac Book from Amazon!)",4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,just to be able to use Echo Show.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,Unfortunately I am returning my devices...,"3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,5,"Not sure of everything this can do, but so far we all love it!",3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,Not impressed at all.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,Great concept but the Touchscreen is limited in functionality.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,I am returning it and sticking with my Echo.i will wait for second gen.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Has the potential to be great!,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Pretty good right now.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,"Voice by itself can only do so much, a picture is worth a thousand words.",2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,4,The combination will likely be the best mid term solution until VR / AR comes along.,2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,4,"Industrial design is not going to impress, and certainly not anything like Apple quality - but it gets the job done and with future updates I expect this to be a long term winner.","1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,1,I thought this was gonna be a really great addition to the echo family.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,"Even after you turn off all the home screen spam options it comes with, your still left with a constant try hey Alexa show me traffic and other tips of things you can do.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,"Even when you sync your calendar and try to get it to just show your up next, underneath is still try hey Alexa spam.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,Highly disappointed I was hoping for a cool clock and weather display/ calendar and not scrolling tips for Alexa.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,Totally cheapens the asthetic of the device.,1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,1,This unit was not at all compatible with what I already set up on my Echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,"It did not know any of the control commands (like shut off the lights) and wanted me to 'reprogram' it separately (I already spent many, many hours getting the Echo to work with my automated home products -and, for some reason, the Show COULD NOT SEAMLESSLY REPLACE THE ECHO FEATURES).","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,This lack of backward compatibility with my old Echo was annoying to the point that I decided to return the Show rather than spend hours getting it to work.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,"Unlike the Echo, it is very difficult to know when Alexa wakes when standing behind the unit  because it does not have a light on the back or sides (like Echo's revolving light display).",1,R,,
B01J24C0TI,1,"You can turn on an audible alert of Alexa's waking, but that disappears when power is lost (as does the wake word for my Dot)  and is not loud enough to be effective.",1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,1,"And, speaking of sound, THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SHOW IS VERY MUCH INFERIOR TO THE ECHO.","1,5",C,,
B01J24C0TI,1,The unit does not have 360 degree sound and the volume is most  inferior to the Echo.,"1,5",C,,
B01J24C0TI,1,I simply had to return this  product because I feel that it was not well thought out.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,before launching.,8,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,My echo show worked 5 minutes ago and now it is not responding.,"3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,1,It is still hooked to my wifi.,1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,1,What could be the problem?,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,I have to say I think I prefer the original.,6,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"I find the Echo Show to be intrusive, in that the screen is always scrolling some sort of nonsense that I have no interest in.",1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,2,I feel like I'm being spammed all day with the 'tips' and any news on the screen always requires you to ask Alexa for more info.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,It would be a much better product if Amazon would allow you to set the home screen to just display time and temperature.,2,,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,2,Hopefully they will give us the opportunity to set the home screen as we like-right now that's not an option.,2,,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,2,I can see me unplugging the Echo Show and giving it away and going back to the original if we can't configure the device to our own preferences.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,So much potential but poor execution.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Trying to get it to play the YouTube video I was is nearly impossible.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,Why can I just cast it from my phone?,2,,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,1,"Oh wait I should be using voice, but something is wrong the search.",2,,Problem Discovery,Human Usability?
B01J24C0TI,1,The same query on my phone shows something completely different and wrong on the Echo Show.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,"Sometimes it shows a query saying ask Alexa ... and I ask it, but the device says I don't know anything about that.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,What the hell?,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Save your money.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Just stick to the Echo and the dot.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,This device has been a huge disappointment.,3,,,

B01J24C0TI,4,I upgraded from an original echo first gen so this is quite an improvement,"3,6",,,
B01J24C0TI,4,I enjoy it.great upgrade from Alexa.my small gripe is when I'm speaking to someone on the other end of the show when I said Alexa it activates the commands.need more names seeing that I have multiple devices in my house.,"2,3",,Information Giving,Interoperability
B01J24C0TI,4,Can't say anything else because I'm still getting use to it.,4,,,

B01J24C0TI,2,Also I think that there could me more potential to take advantage of the screen.,"1,3",O,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Update: I'm returning the device as there is still no way to turn off the text ('suggestions') and my 30 days id's almost up.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,Never buy version 1 of anything.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,If they fix it I might repurchase.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Device is OK but the home screen is cluttered and busy with text that you can't turn off.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,1,If you turn off the trending topics you get an endless stream of Alexa tips but there's no way to turn off the text.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,3,My son is also using the Show to watch some videos in the kitchen instead of retrieving away.,6,,,
B01J24C0TI,3,We also like to use the Show to display recipes.,6,,,
B01J24C0TI,3,We found the Alexa very slow compared to the Dot and Original connected to the same Wi-Fi network so we can only assume the slow response is due to the device and not the network.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,3,"When we ask Alexa to take an action, there is a good time of silence before Alexa responds.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,3,There is also a break between each songs - a much longer duration than we have seen with the Dot or the original.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,3,The kids calls this Alexa the Stupid one... We hope this will be fixed with a software upgrade very soon.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,1,The device will not pair with my account so many of the features that I use the regular Echo device for will not even work on this device because it won't properly pair the account to my app.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,"There is no way to reset or re-pair the device from what I can see, and there is no help me section for the device either.",2,,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,1,Can someone please contact me for assistance.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,I didn't want to put it out here on this forum but I don't have much of a choice since Amazon seems to hide any way to talk to a person about an issue with a product they have.,"3,7",,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Bought a second Show so that I might communicate with my sister in Illinois.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,We did not understand that she had to have a Smart phone in order to make calls--and apparently two different Amazon techs told her this.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,This entailed her having to buy a phone she did not want and extra expense.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Had this been pointed out to her we would have just stuck with the Dot we originally sent her for this past Christmas.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Because of our 'gift' she had to buy a phone and now has expensive monthly bills.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Wish I had not bought it!,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"Really great product but it's not ready for prime time, the software looks more like a beta version, still missing a lot of basic features and settings.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,"Yo can't change the info on the home screen,  Another HUGE issue is that only works with a US address, our company has an office in South America and another one in Europe and I usually work in those offices a few months a year and the Echo Show is a big NO if you try to use it oversees, I work for a tech company so I know it's extremely easy for Amazon to allow to enter a city or state that is not in the US for the local weather and other features.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,I will change my review to 5 stars once they fix all these issues and they make the OS more user friendly and allow us to fully customize the home screen and other features to better suit our needs.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,3,I don't use it for phone use however so that I can't rate,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Unless you have ALOT of people with one I would just suggest the Echo.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,3,For now I give it 3 stars.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,3,It's still in its infancy but I think it has great potential.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,3,"I'm hoping that a year from now it will earn 5 stars, keep working the software.","3,2",,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,3,It's OK for the initial rollout and I look forward to improvements over the next year or so.,"3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,3,For some reason it won't play all of the movies or tv shows included with Prime that I can play on other devices.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,2,The quality of the sound for music is below average.,1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,2,For this reason I am returning the Echo Show.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,A bit disappointed but I am sure they will get it corrected with the next model.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,Lousy design from base perspective.,1,C,,

B01J24C0TI,2,"Also, another feature that could have been added is, based on the history of all the search a user has done, can alexa start a conversation with the user when needed, something like I was searching for a product and I would like to know when it becomes available, instead of an email, Alexa starting a conversation would be better too..",2,,Feature Request,

B01J24C0TI,2,It is complicated to figure out how to change or delete 'cards' and how to stop the screen from constantly changing (and some of the text will keep changing all day no matter what - no way to turn it off).,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,I tried playing youtube videos on it - and it does ultimately work - but it is so convoluted and frustrating on how to get the video you want - that I will probably not bother.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,5,"I'm sure I'll find a zillion uses for it -- so far, I think it's great to be able to actually see my shopping list on the screen and I guess I just like 'seeing' (as opposed to hearing) the weather, the name (amd lyrics) of the song that's playing and other things.","2,6",,Information Giving,

B01J24C0TI,4,At that point I will let you know.,8,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,This product is severly limited in its ability to interact with the outside world because it must have an 'external app' in order to be set up and used for more then an alarm clock,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,4,Everything about this device is speculator.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Only reason it gets just 4 stars is the angle of the camera.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,5,I bought the Pebble after a lot of deliberation and also tried other sites.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Amazon Prime was absolutely great in delivery.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,As far as the watch is concerned it's great!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It's not for those who like swanky timepieces but more for those who prefer utility.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I can answer all my notifications.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,The voice response is very accurate.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The battery life is great too, lasts more than 5 days of moderate usage.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Presently, loving it!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I often don't hear my phone ring—or forget to take it off Do Not Disturb.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,This makes sure I'm aware of all calls (and can ignore ones I don;t want to take without having to get my phone out.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I just have to remember to take it off when I take a nap since it will vibrate even when the phone is on Do Not Disturb.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,I have worn a wrist watch for at least 60 years and don't want to have to pull out my phone to see the time.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,So this meets two needs for me.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Shortcomings are no sound or vibration notification for texts.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,I've checked all the settings I can find.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"It would be nice to be able to reply to texts (on iOS), but I really don't consider not being able to do so much of a shortcoming at this point.",2,,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,4,love these.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,They are more than a watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I just wish they were Windows 10 savey.,2,,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,4,Decent watch overall.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"My needs  were simple, something for notification and I don't want to pay the Apple Watch price.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"So far I'm happy with it, bluetooth is always connected and I get all my notifications.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Although I had the watch self disconnect a couple of times, but for the price I can live with it.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,The brand new product doesn't work.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I can't charge it and because I'm an overseas buyer, Amazon won't help at all.","1,7",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,:(,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"For a watch that can be found under a $100, it does what I want.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"What I was looking for was a smartwatch that tells time, notifies me on who's calling, receive text messages, and notifications from apps that I choose I want to be notified from.","2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,They have other cool features but those I mentioned were the most important to me.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,A really big plus on this watch is the battery life.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,So far I got 5 days and 10 hours.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I'm sure I could have gotten more but I didn't want to risk my watch die on me while I'm out and about.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I owned this watch of less than a month before I started having issues (moisture under the screen, not pairing with my phone, 8hr battery life) I contacted pebble before they went out of business it took them over a month to respond to my email and they then refused to fix my pebble","1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Its a cool watch and it's thin.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I bought it thinking I could set a lot of vibrating alarms for my son to go off throughout his classes to get him to focus.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,You can only set up to 10 alarms.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,But I put the snooze on for 10 minutes.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,That would've worked perfectly if my son hit the zzzz instead of the X. The.other smart watches the alarms will only sound no vibrate.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's not a touch screen it works with buttons.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's a duller screen than an LCD screen.,"1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,But I suppose that's why this watch battery will.keep a charge for a longer time.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It's all right but for me it has a very steep learning curve.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It comes with scanty instructions and their 'help' page needs lots and lots of work.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Maybe I'm just too old to jump right on the system so I'll try to find a 14 year old to help me out.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Yes the company is gone, and the servers could stop working any day, but it was a really good smart watch for the price, the biggest reason being it wasn't trying to do too much and it had the right display tech for a watch.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I really don't understand why they were the only ones to use the e-ink screens.,1,O,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"You can always see the display, the light worked great for when there wasn't ambient light, and it's plenty responsive enough for whatever you were doing on your watch.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,The fact you can get 3 or 4 days of battery life from it should have made it the standard.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I like that it wasn't trying to replace my phone, it does the activity/sleep tracking stuff that most people wanted, and displays notifications and such, and even allows simple replies.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I loved that it worked with my running app to show stats and allow me to pause my workout too.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wasn't sure I would like or use a smart watch but honestly I bought this one as a backup in case my current one dies.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Eventually Fitbit may come out with the spiritual successor to the the Pebble, but until then I'll just have to hope these survive.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,My watch came with a scratch on it.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"The packaging looked perfect but when I opened the package, I found that there was a scratch on the watch.",7,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I love this watch, and I'm so disappointed they went out of business.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It's got the perfect features at the perfect price point.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I used to own an old, original pebble.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The uppgrades this offers are a color display, a more stylish appearance, more apps (such as health tracking), and a mic for quick text replies.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I especially like the mic, as it solves the problem of not being able to easily reply to texts.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Definitely a great addition to and extension of my phone.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Horrible watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Very hard to read the dim lit screen, really dont waste your money, not even worth it.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I dont normally write reviews, mostly  because im satisfied with the product, but this review  was necessary.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Battery life is a little less than expected, and I've been doing my best about not playing incessantly on it to detract from what the average life would be.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It seems to run on average about 3-3.5 days, though what it does in that time makes it well worth it.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Let's make this as simple as possible; If you're one of those guys (or girls) who's friends acknowledge that calling you will get nothing done because you will not answer, this is the device for you.",6,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I can take a glance at my phone when I feel the tell-tale signs of an incoming call from my pocket, and see the name and easily just choose to move on with my day sans that person.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Text messages?,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Psh.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,You can set up the canned response 'Go away.',"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,and solve that problem one instance at a time!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"For the procrastinator, the plan-flaker, this is ideal.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Also, you know, if you like getting notifications, controlling your music, news, weather, etc.",6,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I absolutely love my Pebble Time!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I owned and still have my original Pebble and I figured it was TIME to upgrade (no pun intended).,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I love the new firmware and color ePaper  screen.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Also the build quality has increased from the first gen Pebble; less plastic, a metal face and just a cleaner and more subtle look overall.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I love that I can now sync my Google Fit with my Pebble Time, and the built in Pedometer is much more accurate.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Another pleasing feature is that it has a sleep monitor which is surprisingly accurate.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,It estimate my sleep time down almost to the exact minute.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Other than the new features, color screen and faster processor it's still the Pebble that everyone knows which is the simplistic, intuitive and useful companion to all smartphones!",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I got this not expecting much for the price, but I absolutely love it!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's much easier to keep track of my steps with it than with my phone, and the wake up function has me waking up in a much better mood.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I love the sleep tracker, I've been able to use it to show my doctors so that they can help me with my prescriptions.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I'm a college student, and don't like checking my phone during class, but am worried about missing emergency calls.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This has helped my anxiety so much!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I just got an update on it today, so even though it's an older model, they're still providing support for it, which is awesome.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Definitely recommend, especially for the price.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have had this smartwatch for almost a month now.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Even though Pebble Technology is gone, that doesn't mean their products are not worth buying.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is still the best all-rounder smartwatch available on the market.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It has lasted at least 5 1/2 days per charge, with a record of 7 days 3 hours once.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wish more smartwatch manufactures abandoned the idea of making a smartwatch that was just a smartphone with a smaller screen and weaker battery.,1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"In my opinion, a smartwatch is not a stand alone device, but an extension of your smartphone.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's not meant to have a full color HD display, it's job is for quick notifications and alerts while giving you the option of controlling your phone without taking it out of your pocket when on the move.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"If I have any problems with this watch in the next 5 months, I will update this review.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I doubt it though.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,delamination at the edges of the glass on display on the first day = (,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"While I'm sure I could find things to complain about with this watch (the thickness, visibility of the screen in certain conditions, the very limited interface), I don't believe I will.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's a great watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"It's simple to operate, the color screen allows for some nice apps and watch-faces, and best of all is the incredible battery life (especially compared to any other 'smartwatch' on the market today).","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I regularly get 5 days before needing a recharge.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Also, there's a good range of apps available for free or pay.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I've been using it for shopping lists; it's nice to not have to take my phone out of my pocket constantly to check what else I need or mark something off when I put it in the basket.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Also, I've got it set up as a step counter and sleep tracker thanks to a couple of low-cost apps.",6,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"It might not do EVERYTHING that the more expensive watches do, but it works well and is a solid product.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Tried it out for a week, it was ok did everything a smart watch would but i didn't really enjoy the interface too much seemed too plain.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,Which brought excitement To a minimum when issuing it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Great battery!,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Light fit but feels like an legit smart watch.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Needs updating and a enjoyable interface.,"2,3",,Feature Request,(example of Feature Request)
B0106IS5XY,1,This watch after 4 months got water under the screen.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,( I only took showers with it never went swimming with it on).,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I put it in rice, kept it off my wrist for a few weeks trying to get the droplets off from  my inside screen.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Nothing worked, under the screen the condensation was getting worse, where finally the watch would no longer charge and the screen was black.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I would not recommend this watch if there is any possibility it will be worn around water.,"1,6",C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"So far after 2 days of using, I love the watch!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It does what I wanted it for!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"My notifications come in right away, I hear my phone and the watch will nudge me!",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I have noticed that my backlight doesn't light every time I push a button, but I think that is because I drive and move my arm a lot and activates the backlight too much!","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,But it does work while I'm still!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I don't use anymore apps then what was on it!,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The health app seems to be pretty accurate on my steps, and that does shock me!","1,2",P,Information Giving,

B0106IS5XY,5,I am running the watch on android marshmallow and it stays connected with the instructions that I was given!,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I really liked this watch, but returned it after they were bought out by Fitbit.","3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I was doubtful for updates and support after the buyout.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Pebbles are awesome watches but had to return.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,They were bought out by fitbit and I already have has some problems with the other pebble that I have.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Allergic to the backside of the watch itself.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Something about the metal I assume.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Large gives where it contacts the top of my wrist.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Worked well, though it is a little hard to see in sunlight.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"The reason I got this for my son, however, was because it was advertised as being water resident up to 30 m.  It says you can swim with it,  but when he went swimming water got into it and it got foggy inside.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Well bought as a gift for my husband for Father's Day and he loved it!,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,However after the first 2 weeks it stopped holding a charge.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Fantastic item.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Not a single complaint.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Ive had one of the android knockoffs and a moto 360.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This blows them out of the water.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Long battery life, GPS, water resistance, and voice to text were the main reasons I purchased this, but other apps Im discovering are surprisingly useful and add to its value.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The quirkiness of this watch works in its favor, and the e-ink, while not a very high resolution in images, works well enough- especially in the sun- very easy to read- thats something other smartwatch companies cant say about their products.",1,"P,C",,
B0106IS5XY,5,"As most smartwatches- this is not meant to be a standalone watch, its an enhancement of your phone.","3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Something to keep in mind.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,If for some reason mine gets destroyed I wouldnt hesitate to get another pebble time.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"3rd pebble watch, this one works well good price.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I woro in a secure office where phones, ipods, etc.",4,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,The watch looks great however I was unable to obtain the necessary application from Pebble.com to get it to work.,"1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,Very disappointed.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love this watch although I have to admit that I sent the first one back because the battery wasn't holding a charge.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The new is better but doesn't last the 7 days the claim.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"For the price you can''t beat it, it does all of the thing you want and none of the things you don't.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It is the perfect balance between a Fit-bit which does almost nothing and an Apple Watch that does more than you need.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,This things battery life sucks.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"It's advertised as getting 7 days, I can get maybe 3 if I am lucky but it's more likely only 2.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I put in a ticket with their support system and it took a week to get a response.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,All that response said was there are a lot of crashes happening that are caused by a new update and they are looking into it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I asked for an ETA and didn't get a response.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I then asked if there was a way to roll the software back to a version that worked and again no response.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I sent another email a few days later and finally got a response but all they said was sorry for the delay and that the issue was escalated.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Still no answer on a time frame.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Wow, that about sums it up, if your one of those that thinks the iWatch is just too bulky and over priced, if you don't need anything but a watch that always has the perfect time, and will alert you if you have texts and notifications, this is your watch, not to mention the time is always displayed, because it doesn't have a power hungry LED screen that needs to go to sleep to save battery power, need to see the display in the dark, just give your wrist a quick flick and a back light comes on for a few seconds.","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"And there's plenty of watch faces you can download to your phone for free, I've been through many looking fr one that just right for me, time, date, weather, and with two flicks of my wrist, it displays a stock market price of a stock I own, but the best thing I like is its low, it doesn't stick up on my wrist like an iWatch would, it's sleek and low, oh and the silicone band is SO comfortable, for the price you can't go wrong.","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Yes it's display is in color, but it's not going to display the colors like you will see them on your phone, there a bit muted.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Also it never has any Blutooth connection problems, and I mean never, I've had it over a month, and as long as my phone is within 30 feet or so, it's linked.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,2,for the money your better off the first pebble.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,...but my unit came in dead and would not charge.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"i bought this a few months ago, its a pretty cool watch, but if you want to add any faces or pretty much anything, you have to buy them.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"too much of a hassle for me, stopped wearing it a long time ago, dont even know where it is at the moment.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is a great smartwatch!!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Too bad they sold out to fitbit.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Time will tell how much longer there will be support for the Pebble line.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It's great not to be interrupted with an annoying text or call.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Just A simple alert on your wrist and no one else knows.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"There are still a great number of apps for the Pebble line, so don't let the fact they sold out keep you from trying this out.","2,3",,Information Giving,

B0106IS5XY,5,Time will tell.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Doesn't work like original pebble,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I had hopes for this watch, now in a few months time, like they say in their blog, a lot of the functionalities will be gone which is what i purchased it for.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,In the end its gonna end like a cheap $2 LCD watch.,"1,3,5",O,,
B0106IS5XY,1,We made them millionaires and this is the thanks we get in return.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I like the concept of the watch, generally how it works, and always on and battery life.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,2,My problem was it wouldn't stay connected to my phone with Bluetooth.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It kept loosing connection.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Was okay for what it did.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Battery life left a lot to be desired.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I was able to return it without issue.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Would say get it if you dont mind charging every other day.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Does not meet the 5-7 day they advertise.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Everything was ok until this morning.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I purchased the watch over a month ago and this morning I woke up with the screen covered by condensation.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"This watch is supposed to be waterproof and I have never used it on a pool or at the sea, I just shower with it daily.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have attached an image so you can see what the problem is.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Great functionality but poor materials.,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,I've had this watch for about 6 months and it is in horrible shape.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,You shouldn't need a screen protector for a watch?,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I had the older pebble and it was built well.,"1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,This one not so much.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Not durable,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Very simple and bad conection,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Features aren't very good,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I tried charging it many ways and it never turned on.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I have to return it for a full refund, I'm very disappointed.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Money west,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,This watch works great for what I wanted it for.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I have an iPhone 6 Plus and the pebble app.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I usually charge the battery about once a week.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The watch seems to track my steps and my sleep pattern very well.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The companion app with IOS hasn't given me any trouble yet.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,Compared to other options for IOS I feel these watches would be a good purchase for basic health tracking.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,You can also get any standard 22 mm watch band for it.,"1,5",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,10/11/16 Still loving this watch there were a few updates that pebble came out with but everything running correctly I even have it controlling my media center at the house.,"3,4,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I have the original Pebble, which works great and I have been a huge advocate for it.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"However, the Pebble Time is a complete failure in my opinion.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"It is extremely difficult to get it to pair, it constantly has errors, the user interface is horrendous, the app fails constantly (iPhone version), and the watch face is really hard to see without the backlight on.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Plus the battery life is not as good as the original, lasting about 1 day instead of 3 or 4.","1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,So it basically took all the positives of the original pebble and turned them into negatives.,"3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I love the display/faceplate choices.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It's easy to read and see.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,"What I don't like is the lack of availability of support for questions and problems, the inavalability of a manual (on-line or in the box) and how often it needs to be charged.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,My original pebble held its charge for at least 4-5 days.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,2,"At first it was working great, doing all of the functions I needed it to do (i.e.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"fitness tracking, notifications for calls/texts, tracking sleep), was always connected to Bluetooth like promised.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"After a while the battery started to slack, as it seems to be dying a day after charging.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Soon after, the watch would stop connecting to my iPhone and the app -- which lost some data in the moments that it stopped working.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,Now I have a hard time with the basic functions of it.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,It keeps turning off by itself at random times and just doesn't hold up to what it used to be anymore.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"After having it for such a short period of time compared to other reviews, I think this watch should have been less than $50 than the $90 I had paid for it (at the time of purchase).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Overall I did like it because it helped me in my daily life as a busy, on-the-go theater undergrad.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Unfortunately though, I will not be buying another other ever again for its short lifespan.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,So I've had this for a week and the first thing I realize is the brightness of the watch is not that good that being said the color also is not very good and the size is small a little hard to see that part is two stars maybe even one star the band has a good feeling to it and paring with a iPhone 6 Plus is good I get all my texts and messages and phone calls that I can see before I look at my phone and there is no ring tones just a vibration I give that 3 stars I'm in construction so most of the apps are stupid .so I think it's a little pricey for what you get also the charger can fall off easy.you have to have pebbles on your phone so the watch will work well know it stopped pairing with my iPhone 7 plus,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,both complains and praise
B0106IS5XY,4,While I DO love this watch there are some obvious pitfalls.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The major one of course being that the company that manufactures and supports these watches was purchased by Fitbit and was essentially shut down.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Now while fitbit has said they will 'maintain the user experience through 2017' who can even tell what that means.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,There is no real visible support for this watch if you are in fact have difficulties with the hardware or software.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Having said all of that, I do really like this watch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Its a great, inexpensive alternative to the Apple Watch and has some wonderfully convenient features.","2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love the variety of watch faces and the ability to quickly check a text message with tracking down my phone while I'm in a meeting is priceless.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only 'problem' to speak of so far is unreliable Bluetooth connection but I can usually remedy the problem by forgetting both connection and re-pairing the watch to my iPhone.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Hopefully Fitbit will find room for Pebble support within its brand, if not, I'll enjoy this watch while I can.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The Pebble Time works really great if you don't set the bar high (I was able to buy at $60 - and well worth the price).,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The first day I thought I might return it - then I realized what it needs to be optimized (at least for iPhone).,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wouldn't expect much in terms of Pebble apps - but as a notification machine (with long battery life) for your wrist - it can't be beat.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Just make sure your notifications are set to show up on lock/closed screen - and you'll be set by how much you can get out of the watch just using that alone.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,My only gripe is turn by turn directions on Google Maps (and this may not be entirely Pebble's fault) - Google doesn't seem to notify the last direction (i.e.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,5,- arriving at destination on right in 300 ft).,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Other than that - love it!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,The company no longer supports this product.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,You need  to download information to the watch in order to use it.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Why is this watch even being sold if the manufacturer no longer supports it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Not an applewatch but is great for the price.,"3,5",,,

B0106IS5XY,3,BELIEVE ME!,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,it has amazing battery life and is very functional and comfortable on the hand.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,but believe me they have the worse customer support.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"it takes them forever to reply to you around weeks, and sometimes they just answer stupid not even bothering reading the whole email.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,and their prices went up.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,your better of checking the new samsung gear s 2 or LG urbane.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,what made pebble special is battery life.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,and right now other companies are stepping their game in that department.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,go for another brand.,5,,,

B0106IS5XY,2,All it shows on display is an electric plug with a lightening bolt above it(the permanent pebble blue screen of death).,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,There is no support to get it replaced .,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Gives the same display after charging for several hours.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,"For what it is and what I use it for, at this price point  - it's a smart choice.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Buyers should be aware that Pebble customer and tech support is very thin.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"No phone support, only the possibility of email advice after a significant time lag.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"While I have heard that others like their Pebble Times, in my case, the new watch is not connecting to my phone's Bluetooth..While I realize that Pebble is a startup with limited resources (and am sympathetic),  the lack of tech assistance is a real problem for me.","1,5",C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,Only issues I have is it needs to be charged at least every 4 days definitely doesn't last 5 to 7 days.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,And it has frozen up on me once but that was a day or two after getting it and hasn't happened since.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,I am a dog groomer and constantly have the watch in the water and am pretty rough on it and it's held up well so far.,"1,4",P,,

B0106IS5XY,3,"This is a very cool watch, too bad the band broke the first time he wore it.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Had to order a new band.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Scratches very easily too.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Shipper did a wonderful job.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Loved the watch, and then I found out FitBit bought Peeble and sometime in 2017 they will not be providing any support for your Peeble watch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Therefore making it useless.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love my Pebble Time!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It does what it says it can do and I am surprised at how much I rely on it.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I even enjoy changing watch faces from time to time.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,It's like getting a new watch whenever I want.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only negative is this: I bought the black and every time I hit my wrist on something it scratched the 'frame'.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Yesterday I took some fine sandpaper to it and now it looks like brushed steel and shouldn't scratch anymore.,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,The only minor thing that actually works out in my favor is that the watch will not vibrate when recieveing a message from a group text.,"1,2,4",P,Problem Discovery,

B0106IS5XY,3,Very sad.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I really like the watch quite a bit.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The apps on it are useful and have perfectly fit what I needed in a smart watch.,2,,Information Giving,

B0106IS5XY,3,"Although you can initiat calls from the Pebble Time, you cannot actually talk with it since it does not have a speaker (just a microphone).",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"That was disappointing to find out, but not a deal breaker.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The other issue as others have noted is the poor battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I have yet to get much more that 2 full days out of a single charge.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Otherwise, I love how the watch fits.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,wasn't for me.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,i used the original moto 360 with the touch screen.,"1,4",O,,
B0106IS5XY,3,going from that to this just didnt do it for me.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,no actual problem with use.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,just didn't like the lack of a touch screen.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Got the PT after heard aboyt Fitbit acquiring Pebble.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Decided to get it becuase I knew it's going to be usful for me anyway.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The watch is great.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Contrast is lower on this comparing to the OG (Which I have) but still good enough.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The only problem I have is the fact every 3-4 weeks I get the SOS screen which says I need to restore the watch software.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Can't tell what's the reason but for now I can leave with it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Pebble is no more exists but this watch is still the best because it does what our smartwatch need to do and for 5-6 days + when you out of battery you still can see the hour for about 12 hours,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,So far has been a awesome watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Biggest thing I went for on this watch was how long the battery lasted compared to most other watches and last pretty long though like anything with a battery not sure how long in general the battery's lifespan.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Open package received.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Disappointed.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,The watch itself seems good.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,a perfect imitation apple iWatch it doesn't have all the same features but still acts the same.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,It's blutooth enabled to work well with your iphones.,"1,2",O,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,thou I don't have much faith in the wrist band.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I think it might be great but I don't know if it will last a very long time.,1,I,,
B0106IS5XY,5,More to come when I give it to my little brother as a birthday gift,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I have not been able to use this watch yet because it requires some sort of Pebble app with a Pebble account to even turn the damn thing on.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"No thanks, Pebble.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Form factor is nice, though.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Love this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Does everything I want it to.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Shows notifications and works well with my iPhone 7.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Highly recommended if you want a smart watch but do not want to spend as much as a Samsung gear or a iWatch,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Bought it for my husband.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,It was one of the few watches that had even the possibility of being Blackberry compatible.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The compatibility  is glitchy even after calling support, watching videos etc.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,But he uses it for a pedometer and as a regular old watch and when it decides not to be glitchy he can get his email and monitor his phone calls.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,All in all the product is not bad.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,We imagine that it would be spot on for an android phone.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The styling is very nice and so we are hoping for some app upgrade that will get rid of the glitches.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,3,All in all for the price we are good with the purchase.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"No problem with the transaction: timely delivery, good price, but the watch itself leaves a bit to be desired.","3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I get no more than 24 hours use before the watch stops working and needs to be charged.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, the typeface is tiny, and the watch itself feels a little too small for practical use.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Not as glitzy as an Apple watch or a Moto 360, but very functional with a great battery.","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only problem is that the buttons feel kinda bad on the plastic model.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The metal version is definitely better.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"And since all interactions are done through the buttons, it would be nice to have them feel a little more clicky and less mushy.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Worked for 6 months and then died.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Pebble support takes forever to get back to you or ignores you completely.,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Don't waste your money.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this watch!!!!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I sold my Fitbit and got this instead and am so glad I did!,"3,4",,,

B0106IS5XY,5,!,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I have had multiple smart watches (Asus, Motorola, and the original Pebble) and I truly believe this is the best smart watch for me.","3,4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I have no internist in having a speaker phone on my watch, so even though a lot of people think that is a short coming of the Pebble watches, I think it helps keep the Pebble's price down.","1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It does not have the same screen tearing problem that the original Pebble's got after a year or two.,"1,4,5",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The Pebble Time is a very reliable and sturdy watch, which is a good thing since the Pebble company does not exist anymore (bought and dismantled by Fit Bit).",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Battery only last one day  apps don't refresh very well,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,

B0106IS5XY,5,The watch feels great on the wrist and reads well.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I mainly use it for reading texts and previewing callers, but I also routinely use the voice function to reply to texts.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I also started running again, and it is great in cooperation with my iPhone running app.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Love it!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Big problem is that Pebble has no customer service to call, everything is done via email and that could take days to get a problem resolved.","3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I owned mine for 4 months and now it will not stay connected to my phone and a frozen up.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,Thanx to e-paper screen battery life is good.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"But display too hard to read for me,needs better back light.",1,"C,R",,
B0106IS5XY,4,Watch strap is cheap PU and causing skin irritation.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,(Could be change 22 mm nato strap) All other functions except strap is successful.,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,"if battery life is important and you don't want to be charging every day or two, this is your watch.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I love my pebble.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"There is no other color smartwatch on the market that has such a long battery life, has a microphone, is completely waterproof and does all the basics(Pedometer, notifications<email, texts, apps, etc), calendar, tells time, etc.).","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,It is very light weight and super comfortable.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I would highly recommend putting a bezel sticker and screen protector on front to protect it from scratches.(i.e.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,slick wraps or gadget wraps) I prefer the buttons over a touch screen as my old moto 360 was always accidentally being activated.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you are looking for a perfect basic fitness watch that is waterproof, has a long battery life...This is it.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only complaints are that the screen isn't vivid and bright but that is what gives it such a long battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Hopefully the newer model will fix that.,1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Now I bought a used one, but this is an awesome smart watch either way.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It hooks up flawlessly with an iPhone, which is what I use, but it will also hook to an android phone just fine too.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,There is no windows phone support but that isn't that big of an issue.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"This watch receives every notification from my phone just fine and has never missed one, and the color E-Ink display is amazing.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,There is absolutely no glare to speak of in this screen and even in direct sunlight you can still see the screen just fine.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It also has a microphone for limited voice assistance and with certain cell phone carriers, you can even reply to text messages straight from the watch.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,It also has apps to control certain aspects of your phone like music.,2,,Information Giving,also compatibiltiy
B0106IS5XY,5,I would highly recommend this watch for anyone who has an iPhone or an Android phone.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I really wanted to love this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The band was comfortable and the overall weight was near perfect.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I had two major issues:  The watch would not stay connected to my iPhone 6 plus.,"2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,I would have to go into the phone and open the app over and over to keep it connected.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,The other major issue is the display size.,1,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Its too small to see most watch faces.,1,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I would buy another one if the display size was increased and the connection issues resolved.,"1,2",R,Information Giving,"Human Usability, Compatibility"
B0106IS5XY,2,Poor battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Lasted 2 days.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I contacted pebble and they basically had me run with nothing else operating which lasted another day or two.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Basically I purchased for notifications from outlook and for long battery life with the expectation I would only need to charge On weekends.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,This failed.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The analog watch face I liked with no second hand reduced battery life by a day.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"with the battery life I had and the fact I stopped using as a result, I would have been better served by an Apple Watch.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Maybe others will have better luck.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Pebble never identified the product as flawed when I reported issues and I never received support that fixed the issue.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I purchased this watch after owning a Moto 360 for 2 years.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I was disappointed when the battter in the Moto watch failed and discoverd it couldn't be replaced.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,The price was right for the Pebble and it serves the purpose I want in a smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,To me it makes no sense to pay a premium price for a smartwatch when the battery can't be replaced.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"As a former owner of the original Pebble (which resulted in defective watches three times but I was still loyal since they were all replaced under warranty), I really like the functionality of the Pebble Time and the always on screen.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,I can live without all of the Android apps as this does everything I need in terms of notifications and the like with somewhat better battery life (usually 3 or 4 days max though - not the advertised length).,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,Where it falls really short is the material used for the bezel and the watch band.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I did see others comment on how easy the bezel scratches but chose to take that risk.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Believe me, it does easily scratch -- I am by no means rough with any electronic equipment I own and out of the blue noticed two scratches on the bezel.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Really disappointed as now there are mars on it that can't be removed.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Second issue is the original band included.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"While it was comfortable, after a period of time I started developing a rash where the band meets the skin.","1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,So had to purchase a leather band for it which works fine.,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"So, without the bad bezel and band, this would have been 4 stars and if battery life held true to what is advertised it would be 5 stars.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Apparently discontinued item  but no matter.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I use it to track steps at gym and it works.,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"++++Yeah, Pebble the company has gone bankrupt, so be aware of this before ordering.++++ However I'm a computer guy so I ordered one anyway.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I loved my Pebble Classic and was afraid these would be pulled from sale or the price would go up once they started to run out.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"Plus it's already only half the original $150 price and it works great (like the original, but color).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,As of this writing (12/24/16) the app still functions so the watches work fine.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,This could possibly change sometime in the future as the app requires you to create a Pebble account before it will connect to the watch (or do anything).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"But they do have a very big user-developer following, so hopefully they will be able to keep things running and Fitbit will let them (and/or not go out of their way to shut things down).",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"***** Update ***** On April 4, 2017 the Pebble app was updated to no longer require or use any cloud based services in order for the watches to function.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"They now get all info such as weather, location etc., directly from your smartphone.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,This means the watches will continue to have full functionality regardless of any online presence.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"This is the second time I've ordered a Pebble smartwatch from Amazon and it doesn't work, it just keeps bootlooping despite whatever fix I try .","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I'm really disappointed.This is a shame and I may just have to take my business somewhere else.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The face of the watch scratched.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I went swimming with it because a waterproof watch should be a sport watch.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I can no longer comfortably read the watch face because of the scratches that appeared when I came out of the river,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Not worth the wait - Soft Plastic Soft Band/Strap, attracts Dust and never looks Clean.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Apps - just ordinary.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,Battery Life -maybe about 7 day's at a pinch.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Overall - Disappointing,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,good,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Watch works fine but the charging cable has a pin that is too short and I can't charge the watch very well,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I wanted a small smartwatch that wouldn't overwhelm my small wrists.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I thought this would be a good introduction into smartwatches, since it's relatively inexpensive.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's actually everything I was looking for in a watch, and I haven't felt the need to get any other smartwatch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I love the physical buttons, that allow me to dismiss notifications without having to look down.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's great for text messaging, especially since you can dictate your messages into the little microphone.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,I get about 5 days of battery life out of it before charging.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"It's actually waterproof, so I wear it in the shower.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I've swam with it in the pool and at a lake.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I purchased this for my husband about a month ago.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"It worked properly for maybe 2 weeks, but then it started constantly losing Bluetooth connection.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"We did multiple factory resets (as suggested online - his phone has the proper version of Android), but now it won't even connect at all.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,The seller said they won't help since it's a tech support issue.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,And Pebble doesn't really support this model anymore since it's an older one.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Don't waste your money on this.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Spend a little more and get a supported version.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is a GREAT watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Bought it because I kept missing my wife's calls and texts from the phone being in my pocket.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Haven't missed a call since I have been wearing my Pebble.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The battery life is 4-5 days.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Outstanding for a smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,My husband had to return this for one major reason - if you use reading glasses the screen is too hard to see without them.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I finally got my watch set up.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,I want to try another watch face but can not for some reason.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B0106IS5XY,4,I do not understand why only today,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,my first go at smart watches and i really like this one.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,i didnt want the Apple watch due to the price and im hard on watches.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This one seems to take the abuse just fine and stays charged longer than the iWatches do.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It lacks alot of the iWatches features but none that i really wanted.,2,,Information Giving,

B0106IS5XY,1,"All warranties are now void, and a lot of pebble customers have been left to the wind.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"It's a shame because the battery life and design really made the watch worth it, even with the sometimes spotty functionality.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,"The Pebble time is exactly as billed, an entry level (by price, not function) non-touchscreen smart watch that is excellent for young active users.",3,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,I enjoy my grand child's picture on the face of the watch.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,If you are buying the pebble to monitor your steps it is NOT accurate.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Example I did 1-1/2 miles on the treadmill and it showed 360 steps.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,My fit was more accurate.,"1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Bought this watch in January 2017.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,4,That's the most disappointing part.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"2 months of normal everyday wear and I have to look through scratches to see the time :( I'm going to try a screen protector to prevent further damage, but I'm stuck with what I got.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"For a smartwatch at $180 when I purchased, I'd have expected a bit stronger scratch resistance.",1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I am giving this two stars as my son loves the watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It is only getting two stars because we bought in June and it stopped charging at the end of October.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Replaced charger but that did nothing.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"For the price of the watch, that is unacceptable.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"If it cost $30 then sure, fun for 5 months, but for the $108 he paid for it, not cool.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Now I see it is going for $80 some odd dollars which bothers me even more.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I have contacted the sellers to hear what they have to say and will update review accordingly.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"The watch did everything my son wanted - played music, had a cool way to change interface screen, recorded everything he wanted recorded in way of fitness, could check mail and text etc.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Other than it not charging after 5 months rendering it useless, he liked it.","1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I like but face a bit small and backlight too dem but other than that light weight and works good so far.,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Wish it had sound vibrates all the time.,1,R,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I know it says Pebble Time, & the package I received said Pebble Time but, it's only a Pebble 2, with NO white screen like it shows in the picture so, BUYER BEWARE??","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Great for the first 6 months.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The battery life never lived up to what I had thought it would be.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I never got more than 3 days out of a charge, even despite doing all the suggested tricks.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I purchased mine less than a year ago, and over the last month the battery is closer to two days.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, it seems to freeze once a week where I have to do a full reboot and resynch to my phone.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,Bluetooth Connectivity is getting spottier also.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Should emphasize however that it was the best watch I have ever owned (for the first 1/2 year),3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,vibrator broke after a month's use.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Luckly amazon took it back,7,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I had high hopes for this watch.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I received it, put it on charge and went to the website for the app.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"The website says the company is out of business, they have no idea how much longer the watches will work, they will be no more updates and there is no more warranty.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I put it back in the box and returned it to Amazon.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,It may be a great watch but if they  won't stand behind it then I'm not interested.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"It's a neat watch, cool features, looks decent.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,But I couldn't get over the low brightness of the display.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I know it's e-paper but Amazon's own kindle is far brighter.,"1,5",O,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I would gladly sacrifice 2 days of battery life (to cut it down from 7 to 5 days) for a brighter display.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"The watch already looks like a toy, and the dim display makes it even look worse.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Don't trust the stock picture on this Amazon post as the watch is no where near as bright as the picture indicates, even when 'shaken' to activate.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"It's okay outside in the sunlight, still not great, but absolutely dim and unacceptable indoors,",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"This went on sale, and I decided to take advantage of it.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"I had been watching the price of this watch for sometime, and I'm glad that I waited to buy it.",4,,,

B0106IS5XY,5,Great investment.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Text replying won't work with my iPhone,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Delivery was swift however,  product is less than expectation.","3,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Can you tell me where I can get the watch fixed or replaced as the watch steamed up inside when we swim with it in a pool,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"i like it but sometimes very annoying, it hangs and reboots by it self.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,nice to own one but will definitely look for a better one.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,No like me,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,won't sinc with phone!,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,You need to coordinate it with a smart phone which I don't own,6,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I gave this two stars because of a very important necessity missing.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I was excited for my Pebble time to come and it did.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The only problem is that there was NO CHARGER!,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,And the item is currently dead because of it not having any charge.,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"If you are going to sell a watch without a charger, GIVE a warning next time.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Also, how about charging it fully so I can actually use it.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Disappointed.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I think the Pebble Time is a simple but great smartwatch specially when paired with Android.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Althought I have two complains: it gets scratched very easily and the ambient sensor don't work as it should to.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you're going to buy this watch, I recommend you to order a screen protector and a skin wrap to protect it as soon as posible.",5,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I bought this knowing it was discontinued but I've had it for more than a month and haven't been able to get it to work, except to count steps.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,There are virtually NO instructions on how to use.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Mind-boggling that a product like this comes with a tiny instruction page.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I may have gotten a damaged model.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Buyer beware.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I like the long battery life and watch face being on all the time.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,But the software on the Iphone for searching watch apps is a piece junk.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"When I search for new apps, many times the Iphone shows only the first page of apps list as the NEXT page button is hidden.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,

B0106IS5XY,3,Even with the limited function you et with Blackberry I enjoyed using the watch.,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3,I did not however enjoy the horrible battery life.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"The watch boasts up to 5 days, and after a full charge I'm lucky to get 24 hours.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I read that refurbished models had battery life problems, that's why I put the extra money into a new model.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"I am returning it for a full refund, maybe I will try another model, maybe not.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It's an ok smartwatch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,It crashes all the time and resets by itself.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,The battery only last a day and a half.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Not very happy about it at all and feel like I wasted my money.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I like the apps and how you can change the watch face.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,The tracking when your walking is nice and the sleep tracking feature is nice also.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,2,"But, far less cheaper watches can do that also.","3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I wouldn't buy it again.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I wrote the wrong review on the covers for this product.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Item works well & as described.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"But, as I am a petite female the watch if far from attractive on my wrist.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,This watch was by far the most feminine of smart watches that would work with my cell version 4.0.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I do not need a new phone & therefore could not buy the Pebble Round.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The watch works well with the exception that I can not find a vibration that I can feel in a loud environment.,"1,3",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I wanted a smart watch so I could hear my husband when he texted to ask where I was as he is in the same Large Place & could not find me.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,I do feel the vibration on occasion & hope that I will adjust & be able to feel it.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Still learning & will update review if it works better.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"But, I would still leave out the Stars for the Unfeminine appearance.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Worst product ever.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Would no sync to my phone no matter what I tried.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,Attempted to contact Pebble but was not responsive.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Bought a Garmin which works great right out of the box.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,No wonder Pebble was so cheap !!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,!,8,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,It is definitely not water resistant..or may be i got a faulty product!,1,C,,

B0106IS5XY,1,The bluetooth connection does not connect every time and I have to shut down watch or phone to get it to connect.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B0106IS5XY,1,Charge doesnt last for more than a day.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have no clue how to get the support for the same,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have now had this watch for about 4 months and I love it!!!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have come to rely on it as an alarm (it vibrates instead of waking the whole house up with noise).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,This is a great watch for someone that does a lot of driving or cannot pull his/her phone out every five minutes.,"3,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"You can read texts and e-mails right from your watch and respond verbally, so your not spending your time logging into your phone to send a 'yes' text or e-mail.","2,6",,Information Giving,

B0106IS5XY,5,I am allergic to metal and hadn't owned a watch in a couple of decades.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,5,The battery lasts anywhere from 3.5 to 6 days for me as I use it a lot.,"1,4",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,One concern I do have is that the watch face scratches easily.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,5,My suggestion there is to get a protective screen cover.,"1,4",O,,
B0106IS5XY,5,"If you want a good smart watch at a great price, I suggest this one!!!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,!,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Not enough back lighting, can't see the screen indoors.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I absolutely loved this watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,It was my 2nd Pebble.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,But it just died last night after only having it 3 months and of course there is no recourse now that Pebble has been bought out by FitBit.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"If you purchase this watch, do NOT let the battery EVER run out.","1,6",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,That seems to be what causes many of the issues that cause the watch to no longer work.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I am so sad because I really, really liked this watch.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I bought this watch for my son for Christmas.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,LOVES it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Fantastic watch - great app, user interface etc.",2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"However, I had NO idea that Pebble had been sold to FitBit and would no longer receive any support and long term functionality is unlikely.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Boooo.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Amazon probably needs to pull this product from it's store as the warranty and future support are all now null and void.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,We all know Pebble as a company went bankrupt but this watch I believe is definitely worth the price.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I have only had it for a month and I feel as if I got my $50 use out of it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Getting a watch dedicated to a smart phone is hard nowadays because most people only have their phones for a short period of time then switch to the next best phone out there.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,This watch is perfect because you can use it with whichever phone you would like and it will work great!,"3,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Very moody watch!,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Works about 30% of the time.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,This watch is terrible.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I've had it for one day and it's been working for a few hours.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"After having some weird glithces where apps that I got for it weren't showing up, I decided to factory reset it.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Now, when I put it next to my phone, it says that the blue tooth is out of range.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Pebble's 'support' is a template sent straight into a garbage bin.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"As for charging, I plugged it in and it didn't charge.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I had $69, and I'm gonna get them back because that was a huge waste of cash, time, and energy.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"I expected more out of pebble, but I suppose anything I've thought will be awesome sucked.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Pebble stopped operations as of Dec last year.,8,,,

B0106IS5XY,5,"It may seem strange to purchase a smartwatch from a company that no longer exists, but I wanted a reasonably priced watch that would send vibe notifications from my iPhone.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The Pebble Smartwatch meets the bill.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It looks good.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,It has a battery life of about 3-4 days.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,The company may be gone but the watch is still good and it works.,3,,,

B0106IS5XY,2,"Watch looked great, especially the color screen.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I really liked it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"However, after I went swimming, moisture got under the screen.","1,4",C,,

B0106IS5XY,2,"Made my watch impossible to read, also zapped the battery so it only lasted maybe two hours.",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Too expensive for me personally to get a new one.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Basically, wonderful watch, but I would really recommend AGAINST testing that water resistance.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Battery life isn't even close to what is advertised...  and I am not what you would call a 'heavy user' ;).,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Probably average 5-10 text notifications and 2-3 calendar reminders per day.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I dont use any fancy watch faces or other battery sucking applications.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,3,"The watch serves its purpose, but the interface is primative.","1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Also, it recommends downloading android wear app for a better experience, but the watch is incompatible with the app.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,"Battery lasts 2 1/2 days, so that's pretty good.",1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3,Overall...it's just an ok watch.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I was in the pool and later when I check my watch I saw moisture, so I put the Watch in rice for 2 days and nothing.","1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Its been 1 week and there still moisture.,"1,4",C,,

B0106IS5XY,4,But that's not what I was looking for.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I was looking for something that is more like an actual watch, and this is the perfect combination of both.","3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Pros: EXTREMELY light and comfortable, looks good, simple to set up and just as simple to use, compatible with both iPhone and android, great battery life, and I love love love that it's waterproof.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,That was a huge selling point for me!,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Cons: The only cons I have is that I am unable to respond to text messages on the watch (I have an iPhone) and I do wish the screen was just a tad bit brighter.,"1,2",R,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4,"I like that the screen is always on, but I do have to use the backlight a lot of the time, and it would be nice to avoid having to do that so much.","1,4",R,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"Bottom line: if you are looking for an every day watch that can also do a lot of the same things your phone can do, then this is may very well be the watch for you.",3,,,

B0106IS5XY,3,Love the Pebble but can't recommend it since they are out of business.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Way more useful than I thought it'd be.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I love the apps and silly animations (didnt think I would but it really grows on you).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5,Great battery life.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I can't tell you how many hours it lasts because I lose track after a few days and charge it when I think of it.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5,Very light.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,5,I forget its even there.,4,,,

B0106IS5XY,2,Couldn't go one day without it getting scratched and this was after being careful becaus of all the warnings in the reviews.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Very, very disappointed!",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The screen has major scratches and smears that hinder clearly viewing the watch screen.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"Watch works though, just misleading advertisement about condition by seller.",3,,,

B0106IS5XY,3,A great watch overall.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,"That being said, I prefer the original.",5,,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The overall software seems much better but the screen is so much harder to read than the original.,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3,You have to use the back light or have super bright sunlight in order to see this.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,3,The original was easily viwed regardless as long as it was not pitch black,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,If you can't read it...... My eyes aren't that bad but I found it very difficult to read notifications on this device.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,I set to the largest font and brightest setting yet notifications are still too difficult to read.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,It is easier to get my phone out.,5,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Everything else is fine.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Check this out in person before purchasing.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,Someone needs to tell the young whipper snapper Pebble nerds that just because they can read things doesn't mean everybody can.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,I should not need to carry my reading glasses around with me all the time simply because I want to be able to read the display.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I don't need glasses to see my phone, so I shouldn't need them to see my smartwatch either.","3,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,The concept is great.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"I love the convenience of not having to pull out my phone when I'm in the classroom, at church, or at a meeting.","3,6",,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"But if I see I have a notification, yet still need to take out my phone in order to be able to read it, that kind of defeats the purpose.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,2,"In my younger days, I would have probably given this watch 5 stars.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"For only 99 bucks, It does everything that a smartwatch should do, and does it flawlessly.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,2,"But for someone who is over 40, I guess we have to pay more for a display that we can actually see.",4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Now that Pebble has been bought out by FitBit, my watch barely works.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,It does not allow for watchfaces to be changed (including the ones I paid for).,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,This was one of the selling points of this watch for me and now I can't do it.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I have tried doing a factory reset and it still does not work.,3,,,

B0106IS5XY,1,I love the looks of the watch and the features.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"Unfortunately, as soon as the Pebble links to my Nexus 5 phone it immediately then drops the connection (phone sees it as paired but unconnected device).",2,,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1,The directions recommend go into the phone menu and forget the Pebble and then go into the Pebble menu and forget all paired devices and try again.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,1,"This is when I find that the right middle button is not pulling up the menu as is indicated in the troubleshooting menu, and this is when I find out that the only customer support is by email (no phone, chat, or text).",1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I sent the support request email to customer support and got the response 'We are currently experiencing a higher-than-average amount of emails but we will respond to you as quickly as possible'.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,Four days later and still no response--customer support is really lacking.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1,I like the looks and features enough to wait another week for support and I hope they can resolve the issue.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,1,As it is I give it a 1 because it is torture to see and pay for a beautiful watch and not be able to use it.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I really enjoy this watch so far.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Only have had it for about 2 weeks and it's really nice and easy to use.,"2,3,4",,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,4,My only complaint is that I've already scratched the watchface to hell.,1,C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,I read that the gorilla glass was harder to scratch but clearly this is not true.,"1,4",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4,Also I've scratched the outside metal area as well.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,4,"All cosmetic, but I would absolutely recommend buying a watchface scratch proof cover.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"After owning Sony consoles since the PS1 was launched over 20 years ago, the fact that PS4 gutted the ability for my $300 Harmony remote to turn it on for movie watching (and redid the control scheme to make even this simple task utterly unintuitive)--now that my Sony brand controllers have started lagging to render games nearly unplayable, I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that non-PC gaming is becoming worthless.Good job Sony, you managed to murder a cash cow.","1,2,4,5,6",C,Problem Discovery,

B01LRLJV28,2,"As of this review,I have had the system for less than 3 months and it has completely died (as in 'cash in that warranty, send it back to customer service' died) twice.","3,4",,,

B01LRLJV28,3,"i got the original day 1 ps4 console cuh-1000, so im comparing the new slim to this one.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"pros: its a ps4 in a beautiful and smaller console, much better controller that you can set to usb instead of bluetooth, improved wifi compared to day 1 ps4, 65w consumption playing destiny on digital form versus 108w from the original ps4, it weight a lot of less than the original, hdmi included, usb to connect the controller included.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"cons: still a lot of noise from the fan and it doesn't have a optical sound port (so i could not connect my soundbar via this port), problems with very old hdmi TVs (the original connect just fine), headset looks like it will break soon but 3 stars because it doesn't have a optical port if you don't care about that then this is the best deal on the block.",1,C,,

B01LRLJV28,5,"Serious gamers would certainly want to replace the earbud with a real headset, but it was a nice 'get you by' feature that I didn't expect.","1,5",O,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"If you get it on sale, it's a great value.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,for the price and games it was an awesome buy,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,We are a playstation family and are enjoying our  new purchase.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,I only minus 1 star because  I hate that  Playstation  doesnt do backward compatibility.,2,,Problem Discovery,(example of compalints)
B01LRLJV28,4,I have tons of ps3 games that are now coasters because our ps3 stopped working.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,4,I like the new slim design and it doesnt seem to run as hot as  my previous  system.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"This bundle came with uncharted 4 game, which  was great.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,We already completed  the game and it was very fun.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It also came with 1 wireless remote.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,These new remotes  are great and fit my hands a vit better than the previous  version.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The fact that they removed the optical audio output from this device is confounding.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,It's included on the basic PS4 and the Pro version.,"3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Without the audio output it's virtually impossible to connect to a PC speaker system (tried a number of work arounds involving DACS, etc.).","1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The Slim is clearly intended ONLY for TV use.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"If you want the higher resolution that a  PC monitor can provide, you're out of luck.","1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I probably got the only defective console ...I keep getting a different error message every time I try to play uncharted 4.....even got another disc from someone who bought the same game , same set of error messages comes up, and my game works great in theirs,..downloaded games works fine ,no complaint there,have to borrow another game to see if its only uncharted 4 that has the problem...and since I live in Trinidad and Tobago sending it back is not an option and it will cost an arm and a leg to ship it back....","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,3,Was a bit a frustrated as I ordered this as a gift for my Husband and Son and didn't realise firstly there are regional restrictions and secondly there is a monthly membership needed to get extra content etc.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I was sent a code to enter for a free year PS4 membership but the system won't accept the code and finding someway to email someone for help proved very difficult.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Also when it arrived it came with a USA plug, the fact that is was being shipped to an Irish address didn't give a hint to the seller that a USA plug would not work :( - I feel sorry for any parent that ordered this as a Christmas gift, only to find this one on the day.","1,4",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Luckily we happened to have an adapter that we were able to take off something else and put on this otherwise they would have been really upset.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I think this should have been clearly stated or an adapter included in packages shipped overseas It is all set up now and working fine but looking back now I wish I had just bought this from a local store,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,My sons hasn't stopped playing for days.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Shipped quick.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Packaged great.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Works perfect.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Slower than expected.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Main menu is frequently laggy, games take a while to load - unexpected problems on a brand new system.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,3,Most games don't even run in true 1080p.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Given that it's 2017 and the system is advertised as a 1080p system (while the Pro is 4k) I would expect games to run at a solid 60fps on 1080p, but the reality is 960p and <60fps for most games unfortunately.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Â This product stuck in loop after updating to 4.50.Need help!,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,5,It's a PS4!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Packaging came perfect.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Set up of the PS4 was very easy.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,I'm absolutely hooked on the Uncharted 4 game.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,It's an awesome game.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Literally ate a disc and damaged it within days.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,My years and years old never cleaned ps3 has never done that before.,"3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Very upset.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Online it says I have to take the panel off and remove the HDD and take the disc out myself which would void any warranty.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,And I cant play any other discs.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Don't buy the slim I guess, look up if the other has the same problem.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Got the system and in one week it started giving trouble.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Has not been reading the disc since and playstation support has been unhelpful thus far,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Its a Slim PS$ Need i say more?,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Well, this is a farcry from the PS 2 my son gave me a few years back...it streams hulu, netflix and other media perfectly.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Bluray is a plus.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I am enjoying a couple of games very much and using the controller is intuitive Uncharted 4 is a blast to play also!,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,1,Bought this in mid July of 2017 and it has already stopped working with a lot of error messages on the screen.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,I gave it to my grandson for his birthday and just found out that it hasn't been working.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Now the window to return or get support for this product is gone and I'm stuck with a very expensive PlayStation that doesn't work after two months of use.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Needless to say, I am not a happy customer.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Pros: It's great fun!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Cons: Device lacks the ability to thermoregulate.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Pros: Play during the winter to keep your room exceptionally hot!,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,It's in great condition--couldn't even tell it wasn't new--and works perfectly.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"The kids are thrilled, especially since it came with a game.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Very happy with this purchase, especially since the price was significantly less than buying a new one.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Arrived in a timely fashion.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Everything was as it should be,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I feel like this version will be left in the dust as far as developers stepping up their games for the PRO.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Stopped working after a month of use.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Enjoying it but the included controller randomly disconnects...,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,description said Used-Very Good for PlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Console - Uncharted 4 Bundle but really... horrible packaging & horrible experience all around SHOCKING!,"4,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,of course i returned.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Kids love it,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The ps4 did work for a month then it just stopped turning on...,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Works great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Plays well.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Sony has the early run bugs worked out obviously.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Just in time to retire it for a new console I'm sure......,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Bought as a gift for my son and he's very happy with it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,He bounces back and forth between this and his Xbox.,"4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"So with that, I'll just say that Sony has once again, exceeded my expectations.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Got this for my son and he's been very pleased with it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,He is find that it is very enjoyable.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Good price, recommended 100%",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,From week 2-3 the console would occasionally randomly lock up for several seconds when a game was running and shut off.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,"A week later the PS4 would never awaken from rest mode, leaving only a flashing blue light on the button.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,I would always have to plug out the console and restart to use the machine.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,"I tried different tips and solutions to these issues but none worked, so this is probably faulty hardware.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,These issues occurred almost daily.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Item came in the time given, packaging was decent.",7,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Item was as descripted and works perfectly.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,My playstation 4 dont wanna play any games,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It is what its cracked up to be!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I really don't see the main difference between this and the PS 3,"3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The PS4 came in good condition but the uncharted 4 game does not work.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It freezes every time I try to play it,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"The product is fine, the seller excellent, the only problem are the restrictions to my country (Guatemala), it's like I payed with dust or beans, why we do not have youtube app and otters, we pay you sony with money for that reason we deserve the same benefits of all.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Produced stated that it was to come with Uncharted 4 and it didn't.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,There wasn't a single game within the package.,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Would like some resolution tof this immediately,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I purchased the PS4 Slim for one game... MLB: The Show.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The console disappoints.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's design put style over practicality.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The plastic feels cheap.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The venting for air flow is inadequate.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's noisy.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Of all the PlayStations over the years, I'm surprised the latest one is my least favorite.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,For the price and what I received was pleased.My nine year old son was very happy and he purchased his extra contoller and five games with his Christmas money and Game Stop gift cards.,"3,4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Worked for a month and now it won't accept any discs.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Idk how the hell to send it in for repair.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Seems faulty, stops working and needs reset after just 30 mins of play.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,Charger cords broke with in 2 weeks,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I upgrade the drive to a 2TB unit.,"1,4",O,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Went very smooth.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Love the games and apps on this.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,Great graphics and lots of popular PS4-only games out there.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Hubby loves it, the game and the machine.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Great deal.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,He has wanted one for years now.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I hope it lasts as long as our PS3!,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,My son loves it1,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I didn't know what I was buying.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,My son wanted this for Christmas and Cyber Monday was my saviour!!!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Got it on time as described but the look on my son's face when he opened the box and realized that it was the slim version was priceless!!!!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I have a VERY happy kid!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Got here in 3 days, box a some dings on it as pictured, but everything inside was in perfect shape.","4,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Hooked up and working great so far.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Would be 5 stars if it would have been here sooner.,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Still a great deal,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"I rarely ever buy used products, let alone used entertainment consoles, so when this arrived at my home, I was suprised and extremely elated.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"My ps4 came with everything it was supposed to come with, along with the fact that my ps4 is like new.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Being completely honest— the only 'used' feature I found, was that Black Ops 3 was already downloaded on the game.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Other than at the thing was completely new.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It's a great console for a great price you will really get the deal out of this one!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Recommend it!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I can't believe that you can't play any ps 1 or 2 games,and not even PS3 games.You can't copy music videos pictures from a usb to the hard drive unbelievable!You can't even play the games you purchased on the PlayStation 3 store what the hell?","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"PS3 when it first came out it played everything from its previous consoles and it had 4 USB slots 3 card readers, this is a joke!","1,3,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Uncharted game doesnt work but fast shipping an new as described,"2,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,The HDMI did not work.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Only audio was playing when I connected it to my monitor.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Later tried with a different HDMI cable and that worked perfectly.,"1,4",P,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This is something that is not expected out of a SONY product.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"The system was said to be new, however when I turned it on there was already a user account there.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,That is false advertisement.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"The system must be used, therefore I should be entitled to at least a partial refund.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"The device is fine, however, the PSN is getting crap day by day; No new games, no backward compatible; expensive subscriptions and crap deals, glitchy transaction system.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,The case construction seems ok but the cable quality provided with this is cheap like chinese ones on ebay.,1,"P,C",,
B01LRLJV28,2,Controller does not hold charge for long.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The interface is so lame that I call it just an update of PS3 not an upgrade.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I own XboX as well and this cheap thing is nowhere near to XboX construction, service, items, interface quality.","1,2,3,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I really loved the killzone and uncharted series and wanted to play the latest ones, no new killzone is coming up and uncharted has become lame as drake has been retired completely; I find no reason to keep this wasting my space.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I do not recommend this junk from japan (unless you're an indie lover),3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"It's ok... between Playstations plus and Microsofts Xbox Live: Xbox wins hands down with more content, easier access to content and overall value.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Not impressed with PS4...,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I will be going back to my Xbox One now (4 free games a month with their service).,"4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"My system has a black screen problem, the visual and audio will randomly go out completely (most when i just turn it on after not using it for a day or two).",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"It happened a lot when i just got the system, not so much these days.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I still haven't found the reason for this, however i usually plug out the HDMI and plug it in again.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,USB port is faulty,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The order came a late.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,But the PS4 is working as expected.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Got it for $220 With uncharted4.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Never owned a playstation but it's working great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Hell of a deal,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Just like description.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Nothing wrong during shipping.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Came on time.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Very nice console,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Stopped working after only 3.5 months.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Originally, as a gamer i don't like going out of my 'comfort zone' when it comes to buying new games, but i must say, i got so addicted to uncharted that i ended up buying the first 3 uncharted's, the playstation itself, ofcourse, works as intended, i still have it to this day and use it daily","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate the business policies behind consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate the monetization of consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate console exclusives.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,BUT there are some PlayStation ONLY games this gen that I'm not passing on just because I think this is a $250 crappy media machine with games that are more expensive than their counterparts on PC and a monthly subscription required to be able to do 1/2 of the things.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,This is the most affordable way to reliably get into the playstation ecosystem.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I did not like it much because I thought that the console brought with the game of Uncharted 4, can explain to me what happened, if it really came with the game or not, I would like to be told to leave the doubt.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This really deserves a half of a star.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I paid for a console and game bundle, and only recieved the console.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,There was no game physically present.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I expected a little bit of a roughed up console (superficial scratches in the console) or a very poor box.,"4,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Instead, i just get a console with a game downloaded on there that requires a physical disc to be in the console in ordered to be played.","4,6",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I did get a refund after going through customer service of a decent chunk of my purchase; more than enough to go out to a gamestop and buy the game.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,That alone is worth another star.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,What really bugs me is the seal of approval by amazon on the box stating that everything in this box is good to go and be sold.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I hope that amazon reps read this review and take it for what its worth.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I am a forst time user of this service, and now i am disinclined to use it again.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Bought the same product twice and both times was defective.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This is supposed to play DVD's as well as Blue Ray disk.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The blue ray disk get stuck every time you try to play one.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I bought this item because I wanted to use all the features but was unable to do so.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,So I guess they can keep it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I been using PS console since 1996, i got them all, and i know this is an electronic product and it going to fail at some point.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,my PS3 last for like 6 years with no problem and the same with the other console.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I bought this as a gift from me to myself but it fail seven months later.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I use it regularly but dont abuse it.Actually i bought the cooler base.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Im not a hardcore gamer, I play for like 2 hours before work, and watch Netflix and other TV apps for like 2 hours at night before sleep.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,So dont know whats gone wrong.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Well, only 3 stars because its the first time a have problem with one of the PS console, my first slim one.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I do kinda regret getting a PS4 as the exclusives are nothing special at this moment but I am interested in Yakuza 0, FF7 remake, and several other titles.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Everything else, I play on PC.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The console will get hot so I strongly recommend getting a base that has fans to help cool it off and help preserve the lifespan of the HDD as well as internal components.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It took a while to ship it but it arrived no problem.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Bad product!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Since I got the ps4, it started to shut it down or the image disappear, the hdmi has no signal sometimes.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,"(Sorry about my English) I'm from Ecuador so I can't returne this defective machine, I think it is a refurbished one, I don't know.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"But I losse my money on this, I was very excited to get one, but now I'm very disappointed.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"In the US $260 is cheap, in my country I had to work 1 month to get that amount.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Will never buy again,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,U4 game not aviable in the box,"7,8",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Once I did the update with the game...when the patch was downloaded the game would just get stuck at the opening and give no message.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,I tried everything a little disappointing considering the bundle was $249.00 The issue I believe is only with the game and the associated update.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,4,Good stuff!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Switches off by its self everytime i play for like 20 minutesand then it asks me to report prob which i dont even know,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,It states a abundle but only received the game.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Very unprofessional.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,was a great gift,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Love the console.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,It's really a good deal.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,The PlayStation 4 slim has a really nice design that allows a horizontal and vertical placement.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,The slim offers all the same options and characteristics as the regular one.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,The storage off 500GB is enough to download 5 to 6 games new generation.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,And the game uncharted 4 was really good.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,Mind blowing graphics and an awesome soundtrack.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,Once again really satisfied by this purchase.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I recommend this product.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I love it.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Came very well packaged.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"However, it makes it a weird noise when I insert or remove disks.. also when it reads disks.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The noise sounds like it pauses from inserting the disk rapidly and the same when reading or removing.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Overall it works great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"My son likes the PS4, however when he first opened it and loaded the game that came with it, the PS4 would not load the game or work.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Gave him an error message, we did clean the game to see if it helped and it loaded fine.","1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,4,I bought him another game to see if it would work and it did.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Hoping the PS4 doesn't have an issue going forward and that it was just poor service that the new game included with it was dirty right out of the box.,"1,7",C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"My son is 28, has had the PS3 and is very familiar with it and handling of the games so definitely a manufacturer issue.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,This was suppose to be a new console.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,It was refurbished and missing parts with the old user still having an account on the system.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The game case was busted.,"1,7",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Uncharted 4 doesn't work past chapter 12.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,3,"By the time I reached this point in the game, the return window had closed.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,This product was packaged with a 6+ lb cast iron stepping stone in the same delivery box.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,There were 2 little pillow packs protecting the PS4.,7,,,

B01LRLJV28,3,Unlike the regular PS4 the Slim is really noisy.,"1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"The Slim is my kids system and they asked me if it was OK/broke because of the noise, my answer is I don't know if it is normal or a bad unit.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I see lots of debates on it being the fans running when hot but that is not it, at least in my case, it's the BlueRay drive spinning at max speed which is noisy itself but it also vibrates the whole console causing even more noise.","1,4",C,,

B01LRLJV28,3,Good product unless you get banned by PlayStation then pretty much useless.,3,,,

B01LRLJV28,3,Very disappointed should have checked Walmart first they had better pricing but otherwise the product is good just could have saved a little money is all,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I like my new PS4, but it's really over priced, this thing costs too much money to run .... you need another controller, you have to pay for every single option, games are expensive, PS Plus needs money every month or 3 months or whatever way you want .",3,,,

B01LRLJV28,1,And the logo on the ps4 looks like it was heavily rubbed?,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"As if someone took an eraser and touched it constantly, and considering this PlayStation is supposed to be brand new it shouldn't look like that.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"It's a Christmas gift for my sister so I can't just exchange it without inconveniencing her, so I'm very unhappy with this purchase.","3,4",,,

B01LRLJV28,2,"I'm sure experienced console gamers out there know to look out for this sort of thing, but for a guy that has spent 20+ years gaming on PCs, it was not even on my radar that you could buy a game and have it *completely* unplayable unless you shell out $5-$10/month to Sony for the rest of the life of the console.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I pay for my own internet access and PC servers exist out there -- there is no way Sony needs this money for me to play Overwatch.,"3,4",,,

B01LRLJV28,2,"For the people out there that will no doubt defend Sony, yes they have the right to do whatever they want with their product.",8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This is about making it very clear to people (especially new ones who I think have a reasonable expectation of being able to play a purchased game without a recurring subscription) that Sony chooses to force customers to pay above and beyond BEFORE somebody has a game purchased and is flat out of luck.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's a PlayStation 4.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,But the one I received is not 500GB.,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,The only time I went to use it on the trip in the beach at the end of my vacation and the GoPro was flat.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Somehow it had switched on in the bag and flattened the battery and I had no idea because I hadn't used it yet.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It was pretty irritating as it didn't get used at all on the vacation due to the flat battery so was a waste of money to have it and not use it.,"1,6",C,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,"Okay, so the video is great and its a ton of fun!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,My biggest complaint and the reason I say its not worth EVERY penny is the battery life.....seriously under two hours???,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is for people who are outside and active and are going to be doing things like hikes and water sports that can go on for hours.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The minimum should be 5 hours.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Purchasing extra batteries is a money maker where there shouldn't be.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The additional cost of purchasing extra batteries and chargers really adds up.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Not to mention adding addition weight to whatever your activity is.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Especially if you are going on a day hike you'll need this and then a solar charger to keep the charging in rotation.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It would be nice if GoPro had a several hour battery life and all of this was unnecessary.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,That said you will need to buy the battery pack of two as a back up and a solar charger if you plan on doing any activity for more than an hour and 45 minutes.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"I went back and forth on whether to spend money on what amounts to be a bit of a novelty, as a non-professional user it is a super fun and pretty easy to use camera that has the durability and small footprint to be utilized in almost every situation that you can film.","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I bought it primarily to do some vlog filming and offroad usage, in vlog filming or capturing dialog the GoPro is far from the best choice.","3,6",,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"Whether it's their awesome videos or the graphics and frame rates that they can pack into such a small camera, it's always awesome!",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I honestly would recommend this camera over the Black Edition because of the rear LCD screen.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You are able to frame your shots very easily as well as adjust your camera's settings all from the touch LCD screen.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Then when you start filming you have the option to turn off the screen to save battery.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Another thing I would buy is a Wasabi double battery pack and charger.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,this camera is great but filming at high definitions takes a lot of battery power.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,Am still trying to figure out though why only Gopro cameras are plagued with this problem (other cameras may have this issue occasionally but Gopro has seemed to corner the market on 'Card Error').,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Of course what this means is that the sport cam that you bought to capture moments that may be impossible or very hard to get in the future (scuba diving, aerial shots, rock climbing etc.)","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,will have you pissed when you're looking back at your footage and realizing that you got 18 minutes of your hour long adventure.,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,"Unlike the older optional viewer, I can actually see this in full sun but using it drastically reduces battery life.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I haven't had any problems with the unit freezing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The 3 had the same problem after charging via USB/PC so I always use a charger.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3.0,"Of the 3 Black, 3+Black and the 4 Silver, overall I prefer the 3+Black.","4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The battery life is the deal breaker.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,NO complaints.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,this GoPro is amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Used it tons of times and the video is awesome!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"This version is great because of the screen on the back where you can actually see what you are shooting, but when its on the mount on a helmet or whatever, you cant see it anyway.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So much fun!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Even a mundane walk around the neighborhood was fabulous to watch when we got home.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Super easy to use.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Configure it to share your videos, or just save them to your computer.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Whatever you decide - Its just fun!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Had to RMA after 2 months :( Spent a month going back and forth with their support team and got approved for a return so they could fix/replace my new Go Pro.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Turns out the USB port is just SUPER touchy.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I have tried different computers and different cables and if I even bump the GoPro my video transfer will crash.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,POST replacement as well.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Have had this issue since day one; right out of the box.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought this unit in Dec of 2014, and I probably used it maybe 4 times, nothing strenuous: snowmobiling,Ski trip once and now the wifi on this unit won't turn on no matter what I try.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I must give kudos to customer support who really tried to help me out, but without wifi its really inconvenient to use this device.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Did a quick google search and seems like there are many folks like me having the same issue.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The deal breaker with the HERO4 is no image stabilization.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Video jiggles around so much it detracts from the content is so so annoying.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It's going back tomorrow.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,What a shame.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Disappointed that it wouldn't charge but great return policy and ordered the black instead.,"1,7",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"It works fine, except for the fact that it didn't come with a charger, the lens were VERY scratched, the cover for over the plugs, where I would put the charger, is missing.","1,7",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The silver cover is all scratched up and is broken at the top and it stabs me.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I would recommend this product if someone has the time to replace practically everything and will but a battery pack separate.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I would recommend this product for anyone who is willing to pay more to get the GoPro quality that everyone wants.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Good camera; I upgraded from the Hero 2.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"PROS: touch screen on back; you can see what you are shooting, and playback Lots of other functions I'm still learning.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Good battery life Much smaller Other mounts still work connects to my iphone via wifi (not bluetooth) via its own wifi connection (its weird; acts like bluetooth, but its wifi but doesn't need external wifi) CONS My iphone 6 doesn't connect with this.","1,2,6",P,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"On the boards, it won't.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I can turn the camera on and off via my iphone, but I can't see what is being shot from my iPhone 6 (older phones you can) mini SD card (Not really a con, but its my only device that takes this small size; can't swap around) Will be a PRO in the future, but now  a CON -- too many different settings that I selected a 'wrong' setting out of ignorance.","1,2,4,6",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'll learn,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera arrived with no battery.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I will have to buy another and charge it rapidly as I need to use it for an event this evening.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Sad oversight for a refurbished camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm glad I removed my previous review especially pertaining to the software for mac.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Used this for two week SW National Park and Old West road trip.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Captured dozens of hours of POV/Dash cam in some of the most beautiful scenery this country has to offer, and aside from notable vibration, the images are spectacular.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The vibration is the only reason I didn't give this five stars.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,GoPro needs to build in heavy duty image stabilization for a piece of equipment like this at the cost we pay.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Other than that, the only other issue I had was overheating in the desert-traveling SUV with full A/C on, and battery life could be extended.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I love how they auto-shut off the viewer display while the cam is running, but it should probably have some sort of indicator on the back side that shows the camera is operating.","1,2",R,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"This product did NOT come with the three-way pivot arm, as stated.",7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Very disappointed as that was for an upcoming trip.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Returned, images were unacceptable.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The camera will not communicate with any of my computers.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Contacted support and they said to update the firmware.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Did it.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,No change.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have some very inexpensive electronics that will be recognized by the computer every time.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This is simply unacceptable.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Cannot recommend this unit.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"The GoPro HERO4 Silver offers simplicity of use, a nice LCD display, and great image quality.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"But after six months, ours has developed a habit of turning off by itself.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,camera freezing up,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I bought my GoPro and it came in Tuesday.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Long story short, it literally had every single problem that you could find on the reviews here.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera overheated -Helicopter noise after recording with the wifi on and then downloading onto my phone -I spent two hours messing with my camera and trying to connect it to wifi.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,In roughly a two hour time span I got it to connect to my phone and able to record using my phone but after having he preview on my phone for 15 seconds it'd freeze and the GoPro itself would freeze up.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I am getting a return and hopefully the new one works how it's supposed to.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,worked for one month.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,then.....will not turn on.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,nice paperweight.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Love this !,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he is an ironworker.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Wow what great video.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,totally awesome and you can wear it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I totally recommend it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I like this one better then the black one because it has better functions and he isnt using it for certin things that the black one was for.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Plus in certain weather conditions this one works way better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,If you work in construction or outside where the weather chnages I would get this one.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The GoPro Hero 4 Silver is a great sports/action camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It works best for up-close action and takes sharp video when you can keep it framed steadily on something.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's pretty pricey and on top of the camera price you still need to buy accessories if you want to get decent video out of it.,"1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"And with such high quality recording options, if you want to do any editing, you'll need a decent computer.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The camera is great for catching high paced action, especially up close.","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Just don't expect the best landscape or far away shots.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Decided to splurge for my 5 year belated honeymoon to the Brittish Virgin Islands and get the toy that I have always wanted.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I got it it was amazing, I immediately took it out and filmed my dog, took stills, everything worked great, until it started freezing, so I had to power cycle it a few times, no biggie.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I got home I researched the freezing, and even though the SD card i bought along with the camera was recommended I decided to go for the top of the line just to make sure that nothing would go wrong on the trip.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Boy was I wrong, every other time I would try to take a picture it would freeze and I'd have to power cycle it.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Every other time in video mode it would start recording, but only record for 7 seconds and then freeze, completely fooling me and the past 10 -20 minutes of footage that I thought I was filming.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When the camera did work it was great, but at the end of our 7 day vacation, it just sat in my backpack waiting to be shipped back.",1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought the camera 2 days before I left for vacation, so I wasn't able to really see how terrible this camera was going to be.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I bought 2 of the recommended SD card, ensured everything was up to date software and firmware wise.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I thought this was going to be the perfect beach vacation companion and turned out to be a great paper weight.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"This is quite a common problem with this device, my advice, STAY AWAY.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The 1080/60fps setting on this camera really ends up looking great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The baked in time lapse video settings are amazing, as well as all the variations of timed video/pictures.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The biggest issue I have is the performance in low lighting situations.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The automatic ISO settings end up creating grainy pictures/videos with what I would consider fair lighting.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The night shot mode with increased exposure times, while functional, is also somewhat lacking due to the poor low light performance.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I've tried adjusting various settings in ProTune, but I still haven't been able to really get a good result.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Overall, still a great camera for active lifestyles and easy videos.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Eh,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Only beaten by the Hero 5, on order, the Hero 4 has operated perfectly and without a hitch from day one.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,GoPro should not have killed the use of my beloved wasabi batteries -1 star.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The product description said it includes battery charger and 16gb memory card.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,But I did not find it in the shipment.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I am not sure if it should be a separate package inside the same shipment or if it should be part of GoPro item itself.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Not really a fan of GoPro......bought this one year ago and its overpriced!,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"images from pictures are less than stellar, battery life sucks (on/off just for pictures - won't last a day)(video recording - 2 hours max), and editing images are a pain.....just downloading them from the GoPro is a hassle.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"1080i videos are great, if mounted to car or videoing distant objects.....underwater the images are okay.","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,IMO there are better cameras on the market.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The GoPro Hero5 is probably the same.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Well made with good quality video.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Pricier than others, but I felt confident with the name-brand market leader, since I have friends who own it and are pleased.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It lived up to my expectations, with the exception that some of the options for settings are not clear by their on-screen labels.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is circumvented by a visit to the manufacturer's website.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,love the handfree option so I can take camera shots.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,the drawback is NO zoom,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Gave as a gift.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They seem to like it a lot.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was disappointed in what the GoPro can actually do.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I think it is a super overrated camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Needed to have the absolute best light to take in any color!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Was ok for timelapse of the moon.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This GoPro is awesome.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I took it to Hawaii, got it wet, dropped it, and the quality of the picture was/is fantastic.","1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only issue is the battery life.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It dies quickly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Sure you can carry another battery, but then you yet something else you have to carry and worry about.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I bought this gopro camera to use for an upcoming vacation.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I decided to try it out at our daughters winter guard performance.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"When we got home and hooked it to the HDMI cable that is attached to our LG smart tv to watch it, the video froze after about one minute of the four minute performance.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We called go pro tech support and they informed me that their engineer's were aware of the problem and said they 'might' get the problem resolved in the future.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We were told we would have to record the videos in a lower resolution in order to play it back on our tv.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It is unfortunate to spend this much money on a video camera that will not perform as advertised and have to settle for a less quality video output.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We are not very pleased with what we have found out and just feel it is something that others who are looking at this product need to be made aware of before making their purchase.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've never owned a go pro but purchased one to record some sport related activities.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Recording some volleyball and paintball matches provided fun video and I enjoyed using it.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've given it 4 stars only because the Go Pro's lack of ability to zoom and constant fish eye lense limit it's usefulness outside of action related pov shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Just 3 stars because they come w/a diferent micro usb charger,but any ways it's amazing camera!",1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,3,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I bought this to replace my sealife underwater camera, which I could never get good photos with while SCUBA diving.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,So far am really happy.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I also bought the battery backpack, deep water housing, red filter, underwater stick, and Knog kudos video light.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The camera is great, easy to work, download video, extract stills.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Pretty much everything I wanted.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Not thrilled with the fit of my red filter as it goes over the display a bit, which leaves me a bit blind.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But the quality of film is excellent---can watch it on a big screen TV and it looks great!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Freezes all the time.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,And Sometimes takes lije all-violet pictures ....,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Disappointing,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The screen is nice for framing shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Great image quality and totally water tight (taken it down to 35m so far).,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Big issue: Generally crappy/laggy interface, which I hoped they would have fixed.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"No remote control, unlike the GoPro 3 Silver.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The app connectivity really stinks.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to get the camera reconnected.,"1,2",C,Inquiry,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Eventually reset the camera, which didn't work because I couldn't reset the app.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Then I lost my phone - hardly the solution to that problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Easily gets to 4-5 stars if they include the remote and fix the app.,"1,2",C,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Great camera but after looking to unboxing videos I realized it came out without the 2 extra set of attachments for the case, meaning the one that allows you to have a open screen and the one you could use the touch screen underwater.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I been buying products from amazon for quite a few years so is a bit of a let down.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I would have given this camera a 5 star rating is the use of the camera was a little more intuitive.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It is a quality product, just difficult to learn to use.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I have 3 professional model dslr cameras and they are easier to use when compared to the Go Pro.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The connection between the GoPro camera and the phone app works perfectly ......,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I am happy with the GoPro Hero 4, just a little frustrated by the screens for setup and changing modes.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They are very hard to see in my opinion.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Lots of options but I wish the camera zoomed in.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,We used the camera on working dogs to get a good view of the cattle in working situations but of course the video was too bouncy so my husband wore it and the video was always too far away to really get a good shot of anything.,"1,4,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Quality of the video is good though.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The battery last for only an hour..,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I basically need so many batteries!!,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"After I used the camera for an hour, it just crashes then becomes okay again... And this thing is not cheap you know!",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I've had this item for about a month now..,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I only use it for a handheld gimbal, and the LCD screen has already gone bad.. 5 days outside of the return policy.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Ive never dropped it or carelessly handled it.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Disappointed.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Worked bellow expectations for one year with consistent overheating in the most average of weather.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Continual issues with turning on and off and locking up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I used it as a dash cam, the simplest of labors, but it still managed to disappoint even there with a constant air of unreliability.","3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"And finally, the kicker, one month after my very expensive replacement plan runs out it completely falls apart, with sd errors that make it completely unable to use no matter which sd I use it for.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I spent months researching the best camera for my needs, but I suppose my conclusion was way off.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This camera has been a sour expensive experience since day one.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll stick to the cheap stuff from now on.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,At least they don't make you go broke for their shoddy craftsmanship.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My gopro hero 4 does not connect with my Samsung S6 phone!!!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,When chatting with the gopro team they said it is not compatible anymore!!!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Are u serious?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great Product!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I purchased my GoPro Hero 4 Silver for a winter trip to Montana.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I got great pictures and perfect high quality videos, I wish i would have watched more video reviews to understand the different settings.","1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"But this thing can do it all, and the LCD touchscreen works perfectly.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The LCD is perfect for seeing what you are taping and framing your shots then it turns off after a couple minutes to save battery.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,If I would have went with the black i would be disappointed because without the LCD the GoPro is a little hard to navigate.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The battery works for about 1 hour 30-45min of filming in 1080p by 60 so do buy some extra batteries.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Cant wait to continue using this thing in all different sports and activities!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Â Took it with snorkeling in St John and worked great for me.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I'm happy with the photos and video, which is much better than other efforts.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,(Haven't figured out how to edit the video yet).,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,But the camera is relatively easy to learn to use.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I used an extension stick and floats.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Seeing the viewing screen is marginal when the camera is extended away from you, so make sure you practice so the point of view is what you want.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can see my angle was above the 'tang gang' and the shark surprise!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Adding a couple unedited photos and video.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Water clarity, depth, and sunlight make huge differences.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This is the 3rd replacement Hero 4 Silver camera I received from Amazon in a month.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,All 3 have the same 2 issues.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The all have the wifi helicopter sound issue and they get hot when used.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,So frustrated.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,After 3 months something going wrong and ita not working properly.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,No support from amazon or GoPro.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Need help in order to check what we should do,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love this camera!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The video is amazing and pictures are great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I tested the video on 1080 and 720 and both look great on a large flat screen TV.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I took it in the ocean and pool and the water proof cases worked perfect.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I would suggest getting some of the accessory attachments though.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The one I like the best is the floating handle.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,here are 3 cases and one is completely waterproof and one is more water resistant.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can't control the back of the camera settings with the completely waterproof case.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"With the water resistant case, you can sometimes change the settings, but sometimes not.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"This gopro was delivered on time and place Properly, but the item was not as satisfying as I expected.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I recorded some footage from snowboarding in the mountains which could be bumpy at times and unsteady, but I thought that this camera would solve at least a percentage of this issue.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Although, the gopro presented the footage without a bit of steadiness.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It was clear though!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Received the GoPro Hero 4 silver, with manufacturing defects does not work, to use the recommendation of the manufacturer had to buy a brand Lexar model 633x memory, I was able to upgrade the software and igualmanera still did not work, from the first day the camera it stays in the start menu and does not recognize the rest of the commands, I tried restarting of all forms and the camera does not work, additionally the camera when I arrived note that in one of the corners of the front frame right supeior was broken.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Please I need to be refunded my money, because the article does not work in any way.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If you're thinking about getting the Session or the HERO4 Black, DON'T do it.",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"The session has worse video quality than the two, and unless you really REALLY need a small cube, the Session is useless.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Black is GREAT for shooting in 4k... for 30 minutes before the battery dies on you.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Unless you're planning on taking 10 batteries with you, the Black isn't worth it.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"In addition, the HERO4 Silver has a LCD touchscreen, which (if you're into photography) you can line up shots and make sure your finger isn't in the way.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have taken an entire DAYS worth of photos and videos on the HERO4 Black before realizing I had something in the way.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Save $100 from the Black, and get the Silver  -Sincerely, from a GoPro and REI content creator.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Check out my shots on Instagram if you need examples of the quality.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,IG @joshmalech,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Yeah yeah - can you really not give this 5 STAR - yes.?,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Only I would like that it wasn't silver, hate that make it black or have inserts for color.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I took it for underwater with a Sony underwater camera ($200) which takes good shots already.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The wide angle and underwater expertise made this rule.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,However when deep underwater I got the green tint - sometimes- I guess in software white balance but really it ruined the video and I can't seem to take out that saturation in post.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Fix that for your star GoPro,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The Hero4 Silver is the best and only action cam I've ever used, but it's not without it's faults.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"* The touchscreen is great, but it's resolution and color spectrum isn't.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Hard to tell if anything is in focus or if the colors are good.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,* Switching back and forth between two modes is a pain.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I can see why they added voice-commands in the next version * 2.7K at 30fps and 24 is awesome.,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,1080p60 is a little underwhelming.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,For actual slow-mo you have to go down to 960p.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"* If this camera drops in price a ton with the new release, you won't be disappointed at all.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Current price point though is way too much.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera freezes....,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have to take out the battery and put it back.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,No need for photo shopping cause every picture is flattering!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,BEST CAMERA for action.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Strong, well made, so many ways to enjoy it weather videoing in your car traveling, using the harness to attach to pets, its idiot-proof technology that is straight forward : press one button and PERFECT, and last but not least......","1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Drum roll please........uploads right on the spot wirelessly to other devices!,1,P,,

B00NIYJF6U,3,Keep getting SD Card error and miss getting vids and pics that cannot be recaptured!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,coooool :),4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Very easy to navigate around the options but one thing I would highly recommend is 'get to know your gopro before your big adventure'.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Watching videos on tips on navigating and how to take selfie shots came in very handy.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I had the camera in the case a lot during our trip with the solid plastic door on it so the only way to get around the options was using the three buttons.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,After a few days of using the buttons I was able to navigate around pretty quickly.,"1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great shots and videos with both medium and wide angles.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Although don't expect the take great night pictures with this, they get very blurry but during the day is a completely different story.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Try it, you'll have a great time with it.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,OBSESSED.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,i take this thing everywhere.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,nothing more needs to be said about the quality and functionality - absolutely amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,one drawback though - battery life is pretty crap.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"have read all the stats on the website about usage times, but find this innacurate in real world use.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"eg: go on a hike - take a handful of of photos, and a few short videos, and the battery is almost depleted.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"always carry spares, but annoying to have to change so often","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I just received it but it looks great and my initial sample videos are excellent.,"1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The packaging is high quality as if you went and picked it up new at Best Buy.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This is my first GoPro and the quality and feel of the camera and accessories feels excellent.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It is nice and small and the fit within the housing is very precise.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I plan on documenting my experience on my motorcycle and enjoying various other activities like the dog park and fishing trips.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Can't wait to put it to use.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Only grip is I wish battery lasted longer.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It appears a fully charged battery will last about 2-4 hours depending on your resolution settings.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Great video quality and easy to use.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I was surprised how good actually.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The only complaint I have is that the battery is so small and weak and the camera as a whole is so small, that it doesn't work well in below freezing temperatures for things like skiing.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The battery dies very quickly in the cold...sometimes within just a few minutes.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera froze the first time it was used after charging the battery, I would seriously consider buying this model - research all the blogs about this unit freezing.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,When I sent it back in I was told that the warranty department had no units available to send.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,now that I have experienced this problem I did some research with people that I saw had bought a hero 4 and a majority of people said they had a similar problem.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Quite amazing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"So BEWARE, and do some research before buying.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Im an honest guy and I have to say I didn't wanna believe in the bad reviews so I took a chance.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Well for the record I wanna say I got SCREWED big time, Battery didn't wanna charge, When it was unplugged Red light said it was charging.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,If you have an important life event you want to record like I did don't count on this camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,WASTE of time and MONEY.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Youll have better video/pics through your phone.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,100% HONEST REVIEW!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I paid $300 for this camera which seemed to be the norm when buying the hero 4 silver new, but upon recieving the package it looked like it had been opened and resealed.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I ignored it, but after removing the camera from its housing I noticed how horribly scratched up the LCD screen is (picture attached).",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Very disappointed.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"So far the camera itself seems to be working fine, but I feel that it was refurbished and I've paid the price for what should've been brand new.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Quite the amazing device!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This was an upgrade from my Hero +...so you can imagine all of the features I am having to learn.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It was a toss up between the the Hero 4 Silver or Hero 5 and in the end I got the Hero 4 Silver because it suited the needs for which I was going to use it.,"3,4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I am videoing my races (5Ks to 1/2 Marathons for personal accountability and memories) I knew I wanted a gimbal and the Hero 5 is still having issues with the Karma and Microphone placement/sensativity.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I am very pleased with the performance so far!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,This appeared to be a refurbished model.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,From the start it would not turn off and on properly.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It still has functioned well enough for my 11 year old to enjoy it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I only got blurry pics.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Also did was not compatible with my MacBook.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Bought a Go Pro Hero 4 Silver on 5/16/2016 w/ 64gb Sandisk Ultra SD card.,"3,4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Got it last Sunday.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Unboxed the GoPro and installed the memory card.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Recorded some clips, probably 3-4 short clips and took few photos, probably about 5 sample pics just to test the camera.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I got disappointed because the camera froze on my very first use as I preview the shots.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Did a battery pull to restart the camera because the buttons wont respond.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Quite disappointing for a brand new product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Overall is a good camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,A little difficult to use and goes through batteries fast.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Had some issues with electronic interference that messed up some of my recording but was able to get replacement.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,For giving good video and fast shipping but screen freezing sometimes.,1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Need to remove battery to resolve the issue.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,im wondering if this is refurbished or not coz i chose 'NEW'.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Also, there is a big price difference from gopro website.","3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"If you want fast shipping, i recommend this.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,GoPro Hero 4 Silver Rocks!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"For the price,best in it's class for size, video quality and sound as far as I'm concerned.","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Will record audio in stereo with the optional external mic/line-in USB cable ($20).,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I like it and thinking of getting another one for hunting season.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I also purchased the GoPro Remote control which makes controlling the camera easy plus it will control up to 50 cameras (sweet!).,"1,4,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Record time is OK, about 2-3 hours but do yourself a favor and buy another or two extra batteries and maybe 2 or more 64GB Class 10 or better Micro SD Cards (This camera does not come with a Micro SD card).","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Well, I bought this because I saw some amazing videos taken in Maui and thought it would be fun to make them too!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Which, don't get me wrong, it was.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, the camera kept freezing, which is no fun when your diving or snorkeling or trying to view videos directly from the camera to the TV.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The camera gets hot, freezes and stops working.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I thought I may have a bad one, but when I started researching, I found this a typical complaint from other owners.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I would have tried to return this one to exchange for a new one, but I was on vacation and didn't have any of the original packaging with me to send it back by the 30 days.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Something else I didn't anticipate was the learning curve.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It was a little high for me since I'm not a photographer or videographer, just a little old!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,LOL.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I had to rely on youtube videos and the internet.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The manual that comes with it doesn't really tell you how to shoot movies or to take pictures, but I guess that's true with most cameras.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I just need a class!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Pros: small, takes great videos, HD, good for shooting outdoor activities Cons: gets hot, freezes when trying to watch videos directly through a TV, once I downloaded videos to my laptop, it converted to mp4, which isn't compatible with the GoPro Studio, the camera only takes wide or medium angle photos, large learning curve for me (could be cuz I'm old), so it took some time learning the buttons and using all the different settings.","1,2,5","P,C",Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Freezes up on playback!,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,What a waste of money.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I bought the hero4 for a skiing trip.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Now that I'm home I can't get the hero4 to playback on the tv for more than 10 seconds without it bricking/freezing up despite trying multiple cables, HDMI and USB.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The screen turns blue and then I have to remove the battery to restart it!,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,What a piece of junk.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Playback interface is horrible, otherwise it seems to be a quality product.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is pretty bad.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I ended up using 2-3 batteries per day when the cam was mostly on standby.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,DON'T BUY - until GoPro updates the firmware to support playback.,"2,3",,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,3,They are aware of the problem and still haven't done anything to improve it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Now I'm past the 30d window to return and stuck with a relatively nice camera I can't easily watch.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The best action camera on the market!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It also works a great video camera replacement.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Like: - small and compact - waterproof housing - TONS of settings to get the perfect shot - expandable storage - replaceable batteries - free editing software for Mac + PC - mobile app is awesome for quick posts, edits, and control - new sensor can 'crop' the video image during recording to give a traditional video camera look (instead of the fish eye) - SLOWMO!!!!","1,2,5",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"- great 3rd party support Dislike: - expensive - many relatively inexpensive accessories aren't included standard (standard tripod mount, etc) - accessories are EXPENSIVE (most are just molded plastic) - battery life is wanting.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,1 hour of shooting isn't a lot - doesn't call my parents and check on them,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I dont like the design of go pro.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Difficult to use, and bluetooth+wifi burns the battery too fast.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I rarely review, as most Amazon purchases meet expectations.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The Hero4 Silver does not.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The windows app on my Nokia 1520 WP8.1 is a non starter on either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I am totally disappointed, as my intended use depended on remote.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I have ordered the Smart Remote, which may somewhat suffice.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"If this major shortcoming is repaired, I will update my comments.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I purchased this camera recently to use on my trip to Costa Rica; the quality of the video at 1440 was excellent so I can imagine how much better it is at 2k.,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I easily viewed the videos on a TV using an HDMI cord which I had to purchase separately.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,One of my complaints is that the buttons to operate the camera are very small so I keep on pressing the record button by accident.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I also had an issue pressing the wrong button and kept on changing the camera mode to other than video.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Unfortunately, I did not notice this until after recording time lapse stills instead of a video; missed recording crossing over a rickety hanging bridge to get to a spectacular waterfalls.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm making it my mission to get this right!!!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"(LOL)  My most recently problem involves the GoPro application for the computer (Windows 10 sucks); still working on this issue with the vendor and hope to resolve it soon because otherwise, I will not be able to work on/save my beautiful videos.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Purchased the GoPro HERO4 SILVER as a gift for my son.,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,"Freezing is an issue, as well as intermittent issues with not being able to record.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Current issue is it will not charge.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have contacted GOPRO directly and will update once I hear back.,4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,"If you google GORPRO HERO Problems, this is not a remote issue, there are tons of people having problems with this camera.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I spent 3 hours trying to connect the WiFi on the camera to the phone app with no success.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Finally after talking to GoPro technical support they said the WiFi isn't working correctly and I had to send it back.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I might have saved a little money buying it through Amazon, but now that there is a problem, I have to mail it back and won't have the camera for christmas as I planned!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,First off this is a great little camera for pics and the quality is awesome.,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"But having said that I purchased this for video, and it does take the best video I have ever seen.","1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,But people be warned if you think you can take a video of an hour walk through the mountains or of a family get together and then burn it to a DVD you are in for a surprise.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Even on the lowest resolution {video is awesome} you will be way over the capacity of the 4.7 Gig DVD!,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was only able to get about 25 minuets of video to burn to a DVD.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I read a ton of reviews and nowhere did anyone talk about burning videos to a DVD.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I already have an awesome 12MP camera for pictures.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Even when I burnt a 25 minute video to DVD it did not play good on my fancy DVD home player.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,If anyone wants a barely used GoPro Silver and accessories let me know.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,If I would have been able to read about burning it to a DVD on their website or any info in the reviews I would not have purchased it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Shame on you GoPro for not telling people about this.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I bought this in the extreme bundle for 440.00.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Since the camera alone sells for 400 at most retailers, this is a GREAT deal!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"You get the camera, a micro sd card (doesn't come when you buy the camera alone), 3-way tripod, two extra batteries and a battery charger pack (off brand) and the headband mount.","1,4,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Overall it's a great deal for first time buyers who don't have any of the accessories which are a must for this camera.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Everything works well.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I do have to say I've had some issues with charging the battery pack.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It didn't come with an adapter for the wall and it doesn't want to charge on some adapters that I've tried.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Had to send it back twice for various malfunctions.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This camera is garbage.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,Bought the GoPro for a scuba dive trip to Mexico.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It worked well through 8 dives to 85 feet.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Video was pretty decent with good color using the WoCase Lens Filter.,"1,5,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Photos were not very good in general.,1,C,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,"So far, I have been unable to recover the GoPro.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It is sitting in rice.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,VERY unhappy with my choice to go with GoPro for SCUBA.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Makes sure you really want one before just buying what will essentially become a paper weight in you house.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I was skeptical about the video and photo quality until I actually downloaded the files to my phone through the app.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I give it 5 stars for that!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only problem I had was that having the screen on drained the battery pretty quickly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I've yet to figure out how to turn the screen off to extend my battery life.,1,I,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I also accidentally put the camera in the wrong mode a couple times (user error.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,haha) so be conscious of that.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Other than that, it was a fantastic investment!",3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,"I went whitewater rafting, waterfall rappelling, hiking, swimming, you name it!","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It beautifully captured my whole experience and I would highly recommend purchasing one.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,Lots of great feature too.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I had the Gopro hero 3 black for a couple do weeks and sold it and bought the hero4 silver as it boasted better lowlight capability.,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I used it at our recent trip to Disney and universal and most of my still pics came out blurred and unfocused .,"1,4,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,In normal light pictures look great!,1,P,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,This camera is just amazing.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has everything that hero4 black has plus a touch LCD so what else do you need?,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Black has addtional 4k recoding options that silver doesn't but to be honest- there is no limit to how much more you can want.,"1,4,5",P,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,"So, you gotta settle at some point and trust me for the action camera world, hero4 silver is the nissa GTR.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The best with a little lesser price point.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This GoPro continually overheats.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The unit gets so hot that I can't hold it in my hand and I'm afraid that it will start a fire.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Mi gopro never function!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Quite possibly the best purchase of 2014.,"4,3",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has lived up to the expectations and honestly beyond.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I gave it to my boyfriend, on thanksgiving, as an early christmas present bc we had a few trips planned and i thought it would be nice to break it out while we traveled.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Not only has it become an essential on the pack list but it goes everywhere with us.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,While the camera is amazing with excellent clarity and durability I figured a few accessories would be imperative to the quality/variety of photos.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"So far he has loved the Joby Gorillapod Flexible Tripod, CamKix telescopic pole 14' to 40', twin pack of extra batteries and charger, and a spare tripod mount.","1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Next on the list of accessories is the remote - while the gopro app has the option to set burst/continuous/video settings and take a picture it can take a minute to connect and is not ideal for all situations.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Highly recommend this camera - it is versatile.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I plan on gifting one to my father and mother who are less than tech savvy but love the great outdoors and live on the water with beautiful sunsets they look forward to capturing.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So I have been using the goPro Silver for a while now using just about every function it has.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So far I have been really impressed with the quality and recordings it produces.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have recorded video on most settings testing to see which one I like best, 2.7k 30p seems to be the sweet spot for everyday videoing for me.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Lets me crop with stabilization and downscale to 1080p and still have a crisp picture.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have used the nightlapse a few times  and have had good results after playing around with protune.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,In the picture settings I have used timelapse to make a few motion lapse videos and they have actually turned out pretty good as well.,"1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,However you you are doing just a regular timelapse I would use the new video function for it and shoot in 4k.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,One thing I would say to new buyers buy the Wasabi extra batteries and charger combo for 19.99 (at the time I purchased) and a external battery pack for longer shoots.,"1,4,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Trust me 1 battery is not enough.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"unfortunately I am not a huge fan of GoPro, this is my second product from them and I have found you are simply paying for the name, nothing more.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Took terrible pictures unless it was perfect lighting and on some forum of tripod.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Video was fantastic though.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The product didn't work, and I had to return it.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The GoPro HERO4 Silver is my favorite GoPro so far.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Built-in screen makes this the perfect recreational camera for those looking to get better photo and video with less effort.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The Battery life is comparable to most of the other 4s.,"1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have taken this to the beach, river, skiing, overseas, and just out on the town with friends.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for my professional video work and for personal keepsakes with my family and friends.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The two best accessories I bought for this were the production mount and the Wasabi Power Battery 2 Pack.,"1,5",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Gaining added recording time and always having a spare battery makes the camera much more valuable.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love the ease of use with the updated GoPro app and the functionality of the high res video and time lapse features.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The battery will not charge no matter how many troubleshooting steps I follow!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery duration is very poor specially if wifi is enabled to connect with a goPro app or the remote control.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It can't replace a regular camera given that doesn't provide zoom (neither digital and analog),"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Awesome camera,  very fun to video my koi fish and off-roading .",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"One downfall so far is the go pro on my Samsung Galaxy s5 will not pair to my go pro , with such a new  piece and big price of equipment there should be no Filmware error.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I have restarted the WiFi at least 4 times.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Help would be appreciated!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Wish their was an easier way to take selfies.,2,,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,3,For thre casual user (on vaca) I don't want to carry around this and my phone to use the app.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,this is the worst Camera I have ever bought.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have not played with it that much but I brought it with me to Comic con and I will never bring it with me again.,"3,4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I was clade I brought a back up.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I would return it but I already pulled the stickers off.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,You had better hope what ever you want to film is within 2-3 of you.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's been a great little camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Wish the sound could be better in waterproof case like the session,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Amazing camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love shooting in 1080p super view mode and getting the wide field of view.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The footage is very clean and stable.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The touch screen options are intuitive and easy to use.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I much rather use this one than the black, the screen helps a lot.","1,3,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I can't wait to go on more adventures with it,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"This isn't the product I was sold, by comparing the silver and black addition gopro hero 4, the major difference is that hero silver has a LCD tuch screen and Black addition doesn't.","1,5",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"But I do now own a GoPro Hero 4 silver and it is user friendly and extremely versatile, great for beginners!","2,3,4",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Ummm.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Where do I start?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Let me start by saying I receive my package super early.,"4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,4days before original delivery date.,"4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Bought it for a Valentines Day gift for my boyfriend.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Came sealed, new and all accessories were included.","4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I was so excited receieving this product and even more excited about how perfect it was.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,My boyfriend will love this gift.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Thank youuuuuu,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The housing that came with the go pro lasted one day and the hinge broke off and cracked after closing the case.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I've had the hardest time with this camera freezing up!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I have friends with previous models and he doesn't have this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I googled and it's a common issue no good fix for it.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's a very good product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, it's high time GoPro reduced its price.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,There is a lot of good competition at one-third price that cannot be ignored to remain in the market.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The other thing that baffles me is why can't the sensor size be increased for better low light performance especially at this price point.,1,I,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,its freezing up on me,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I bought this for a trip to Mexico and it was everything I needed.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Waterproof, small form factor, took great photos and very high quality HD video.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I got the package deal with 2 extra batteries and a charger for the same price as just the camera so you can't beat that!,"1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Batteries last about 2 hours of filming which I found to not be an issue with the extra 2 I got in the package.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The camera itself is great I love the display on the back and it was super easy to get it set up and take great high quality video.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If your looking for a small 'Action Camera' don't get a knock off, buy the real deal!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Highly recommend!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"the box was smashed when i go it, good thing the camera is can handle abuse.","1,7",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Poor image quality on the LCD, with stripes.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Let's hope Hero5 is of better quality,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Had this for a year+ now and must say I continue to be impressed by the quality of the shots I get (given it's size and lens).,"1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have a couple of DSLR bodies and lens - both capable of HD movies - but this GoPRo is my 'goto' choice for movies.,"3,4,5,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It is also my goto choice for wide angle shots (what it is built for) and of course, I use it when I will encounter water that would kill my DSLR's.","1,5,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Got a great movie of a waterfall - from the bottom on a boat - even though I was getting drenched.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The only negative is the 'sparsity' of buttons - even thing is controlled by 3 buttons and that takes a bit of getting used to.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,But it is pretty much required by the waterproofing.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I also use it for 'candid' street shot photography with a belt or shoulder strap attachment.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm overwhelmed from all the settings and options.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I suppose that can be a good thing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But I like to keep it simple.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,My favorite is the super slow mo.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Don't buy unless you're into wet action sports like snowboarding, surfing, diving, outdoors, etc.","3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's an expensive toy otherwise.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Go Pro Studio also takes some time to learn and you have to download it for windows - takes up a lot of resources.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I love this camera!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is my first camera purchase since my Nikon CoolPix S630.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I bought it primarily for the pool and beach but find myself taking it everywhere now.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Before purchasing I went back and forth contemplating this one and the Session model.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Even at twice the price I think it was worth it to get the HERO4 Silver.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The back screen is great so you can actually see what you are recording.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Not to mention the kids always want to see themselves so the playback function is really nice.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Be sure to get extra batteries and memory cards if you plan on recording all day long.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"With a 64gb card you will get around 4hrs at 1080p, less at higher resolution of course.",1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This camera has lived up to the hype I have been hearing about for yrs.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Just be aware, purchasing this camera will make you want to record everything in life.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Battery exploded,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Decent quality video if there's enough light but not extremely high so not great for Pro-End looks.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I, like many before, experience a problem with a helicopter sound in the video.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I read others' issue and saw that calling CS helped them out... Maybe they got sick of all the returns because when I called they gave me a long list of requirements I had to do (recording video and send to them) to prove I wasn't lying.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,In the end I just decided that I don't even care about the audio from my GoPro so wasn't worth the red tape they were binding me with to get fixed/replaced.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The GoPro gets hot and stops working within 20 minutes.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The battery needs to be pulled to reset.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Once reset it can be use for a few more minutes maybe 10 minutes and then it looks up again.,"1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"This past summer, I bought the Hero4 Silver GoPro for my trip to Southeast Asia.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The quality was great, but a week into the trip, the housing case's attachment tab broke off while unscrewing the GoPro from the headpiece.","1,4","C,P",,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This ruined every shot for the rest of the trip because I was not capturing even shots (the camera was tilted).,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I am very unsatisfied with this product.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera was a Christmas gift that we bought in august.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The battery will not charge and now i find out cant return it.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,One of the best investments I've made this year.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Because of its convenience and sturdy case I dare to take it with me to events where delicate cameras would be at risk.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The GoPro is good at capturing action and delivers really nice 'non fisheye' footage as wel.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Performs great at daytime, not so good in low light conditions.","1,3",R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If you plan to record audio you should consider using an external microphone, or only film in quite environments so you can boost volume during editing.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If the circumstances are right, the audio is pretty good!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,While using the closed case you shouldn't bother trying to record any audio.,"1,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The screen is small but really nice.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Settings can be easily changed on the go and even playback is decent on the tiny screen.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,If you install the GoPro app this camera can stream media to the phone for playback and pointing the camera.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Changing the settings with the app is also possible.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I liked the Go Pro Hero for it's portability and power, but when I realized how stationary I really am, I returned this little camera because I didn't find much use for it.","1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I later purchased a Nikon DSLR that better suited my needs.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Still, if you're looking for something to take on trips, or if you're into extreme sports, the Go Pro Hero is for you.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,i love the gopro camera!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I had a gopro hero 3 for 2 years and I decided to upgrade for the gopro 4.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It came today and the wifi side button is not workng and also the charger usb is not working properly.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Being used to GoPro from the beginning, this is par for the course.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's a damn good course to be exact.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's  hard to grade this since all GoPro cameras work great in the latest generation.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The camera is great for the intended purpose.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I have purchased several knock-offs previously and now I wish I had paid for the GoPro to begin with.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Clearly many features that give this camera a big advantage.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Only issue is the attachments are plastic and cheap.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Be careful or you will loose the camera.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The camera is of pretty good quality and does the tasks I need it to do.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The editing software however is horrible.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It continuosly crashes during trimming videos wasting my time over and over.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It is very frustrating.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is horrible.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Ordered this because I bought a new 2016 Toyota Tacoma and one of the selling features of the truck was 'go pro ready'.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Which amounts to a plastic mount in place on the windshield!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,What a gimmick.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The first go pro ordered, would record for a little over an hour, then dead.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera became so hot I could hardly touch it to get it out of the case.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Returned it and another one came very quickly.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The time it took me to set up the first one, package it to send back, coordinate with UPS and then set up the second one ... and it won't hold a charge either.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Something about this camera or faulty battery is absolutely ridiculous, and what a huge price to pay for junk!","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I have charged it on the USB port, the plug in usb adapter and it will turn on briefly and dead again.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"$400 and more of my time to try and make this work, potential of setting up another one?",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Don't have time to keep messing with this expensive equipment that doesn't deliver!!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Guessing maybe they are getting rid of old stock and really don't care about the customer.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I bought it to take it on my runs with me when I leave my phone behind, and am a bit disappointed in the image quality of stills: Moving objects come out blurry every single time, despite the dedicated burst mode.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Non moving objects and scenery look much worse than on my Note2, and even my Galaxy  Gear smartwatch, incredibly.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Connecting my Android phone is more hit than miss, I have to try about 5 times restarting the camera and app, until I finally get a connection established.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I would put up with it if the pictures came out better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It just doesn't seem like they used a good image sensor.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I am sure it's a great camera for action videos, but again, I just need something small that takes great pictures, and the Hero 4 isn't it.","1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I will say that pictures come out slightly better than on my Polaroid Cube.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Something else that irks me is the fact that despite a bazillion accessories out there, there is no way to attach a lanyard to the camera if I use it without the waterproof case, which I don't need, and which would make the camera too bulky.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I think I will return it for the above stated reasons, even though I love its small size and Wifi when it works :(","1,3,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Absolutely love this!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,This is my first GoPro and I am hooked.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Small, lightweight and fun to use.","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"With all the different attachments and mounts there are, the possibilities are limitless!",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Shoots in amazing quality and has a good field of view for such a small video camera.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Love that it has the screen so you can check what you are taking a picture and/or video of.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I have a few friends that have older versions that don't have the screen and they all said they wish that theirs did for that very reason.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Good: Excelent Resolution Video.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Excelent day light picture Bad: With or without Night photo settings the pictures on night works only by tripode, and using the app.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,If you PUSH the botton the photo will be moved.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's not a good camera to take night photo.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,For this price you could get nearly Reflex camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Conclusion: It's a perfect second camera to use in sports or water or filming but not your main camera to your holidays,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Way overpriced for what you get.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Yes, it's very small and portable.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Shoots nice video.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,That's it.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,You have to buy everything extra at an already high price.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Wasn't what expected.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,We returned.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"The camera is awesome as far as the pictures however, very disappointed that the wi-fi disconnects after 30 sec to a minute after connecting to a cellular device","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"After using a camera without a video back, I found using the Hero4 Silver a 1000 times easier because of the video back.","1,4",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Sure most camera have a wi-fi app that you can use to frame a shot and see what you are recording, but it always has limitations - like trying to use a wi-fi connection in the water (hint - it doesn't work).","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Using the video back is much, much easier.",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"You can also replay recorded clips with the back, so you can review what you just shot without having to figure out how to get the video onto another device to view.","2,6",,Information Giving,

B00NIYJF6U,5,The only thing this camera doesn't have that I would find useful is vibration reduction (which the Session has) to reduce cockpit vibration.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Battery life is decent at the setting described above.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"This little unit doesn't heat up as drastically as the Session, and total record time is just under 2 hours with a fully charged battery.",1,P,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,It constantly freezes up when connecting or disconnecting through the usb port.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The only solution is to pull the battery out and reinsert it.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,4,I does it job on capturing moments.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,One little problem for me is the cracking of the front faceplate.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It seems that this is fragile part of the gopro specially when your not careful in closing the latch of his case.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,We returned the unit because of this issue and replace by amazon immediately.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,it worked great for the 2 out of the 4 months I've had it and now if I take a picture it will freeze automatically and now i can't use it and I am looking to return it,"2,3,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Estimated provider.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I bought the camera a year ago and stopped working a month ago.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I quit using it with the official charger.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I asked and they tell me that it is the motherboard.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I would like to know what you think about this?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Thank you,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I got the camera on time but the LCD screen is not working.,"1,7",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,what can I do about it?,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I'm giving 3 stars only cause the battery was drained within 2hrs of use.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,You have to get more batteries to keep on hand!,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Love it but mature users with less than stellar vision beware.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It is next to impossible to read the menu on such a tiny screen.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The menu LCD is dark grey writing on a light grey background.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Not a big deal if you are navigating via the touch screen but with the waterproof case the touchscreen is not available.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,No back light on the tiny front menu screen makes it difficult to read it indoors and impossible  in outdoor bright light.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Took it out of its storage case today to use and one of the clear attachments has broken off.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I bought it last month in prep for an upcoming trip.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Didint received memory card,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Product stopped working right before the vacation I bought it for now I'm stuck with it and wasted 500 dollars between the camera and accessories,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I mostly used this around my model rail layout but recently needed the phone app again to do some outside shooting.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Lo and behold:no internet, no phone app.",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,1,What in the world is the point of an action cam that requires an internet connection?,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The camera is amazing, I really like it and it didn't take long to figure out the basics.","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,At first I wan't sure about purchasing it due to some reviews of recieving a defective camera with a purple screen and was debating on getting it locally.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"However, I have been using the camera a lot in the past couple weeks and not one problem.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The reason for giving it a two star is the battery.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I believe I recieved a bad battery, it doesn't last long at all.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'lll have it fully charged and in a few minutes it drops from 100% to 70% then about 25 minutes it will go completely dead.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,When I first got it I fully charged the battery before turning it on and using it and it did this the first time using it.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Ever since I got it iv been fully charging it and letting it fully die and nothing is changing.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Over all I love the camera and I'm glad I got it, just it was a major let down about the battery and having to stay close to an outlet.",1,"P,C",,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have not been impressed with the GoPro at all.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,This is the first GoPro I've had and I've found that it freezes up during the middle of a recording (and I take like 5 minute max videos) and the image quality is pretty poor.,"1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It is small and lightweight but to me that is where the pros stop.,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Not sure if something is wrong with the one I ordered for my husband or if he just has no clue how to use it.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"After charging the battery, it went dead after only a few minutes.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Also, while playing back some video, it freaked out so he removed the battery.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Now it wont work at all!!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Said the underwater picture was very clear before it freaked out.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery doesn't last long wifi remote zaps the battery pretty fast,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Most fun camera I've ever owned.,3,,,

B00NIYJF6U,5,The GoPro app for iPad is perfect for viewing and setting up video and picture modes.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"The only thing I wish for is that they update the camera so you can mute the audio while recording , that would be a plus, it would reduce the wind noise, tomorrow I'm going to hit the ocean with it for the first time, I'm sure all will work out fine , I already can see I'll be coming an GoPro action hero, and it will become a good exercise machine.","2,4",,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Buy it you'll love it!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Absolutely awesome product and amazon had a substantially better price than we were able to find in stores.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I was able to get the warranty, additional batteries, and accessories for over $200 cheaper than for the equivalent in stores.",7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Product works great and takes incredible videos and photos.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Works great and has had no issue being submerged deep in the ocean facing tough waves and currents.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The waterproof case is very durable and has kept the GoPro scratch free and like new.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I purchased the go pro to record our sailing practices (we race sailboats) and then send them to the crew for post practice or post race review.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"however, the recordings are 1 hour long, approx 500mg in size and takes 12 hours or so to download to computer and upload to dropbox.",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"so, for my purpose it was a waste of money.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,having said this the quality is good and operating is good but the software to download to computer IS NOT intuitive.,"1,2,3",P,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera works sometimes.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Freezes up sometimes and I have to remove the battery to restart it.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Happens usually right after startup before I have a chance to begin recording.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Amazon won't exchange because it's after 30 days, yet GoPro has a 1-year warranty on these cameras.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Very disappointed.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I like the camera; I just want one that works.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,What more can you say about GoPro they had the top-of-the-line when it comes to action cameras.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I've experienced the same excellence than many thousands and millions of people have experienced with the GoPro hero's silver.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Terrible battery life.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Good photo and video quality, though, except when it's really sunny and there are no focus capabilities.",2,"P,C",Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Small and convenient.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Worked great.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Less than a year later without any use won't turn on.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Kind of bummed,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"A good selfie stick and an iPhone is cool and all, but for the people who would like to catch everything you need a go pro.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Has yet to fail me on my travels, i especially bought this for my ocean trips.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I like to constantly stay doing water activities and long drives where I do not have to keep an eye on the camera.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"The smaller versions do not carry a screen , but this one does and it helps a ton.","1,5",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It's always good to look back at what you are taking instead of taking a wild guess and regretting it later.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Must have for the adventure type or who like to capture video memories.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can also set in in video and photo mode so it does both at once.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Use a 128gb sd card so that you do not run out of space.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Worked fine for the first couple uses, then as soon as I put it to the test in the heat of the day and shaky conditions, it decides to freeze and not function.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Had to remove battery to restart it, now the screen has different colored lines going through it.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I'm going to sell it to a pawn shop and buy one with a warranty, since the seller offered zero and little to no real return policy.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I love my GoPro, but the helicopter noise is simply not acceptable.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,It has been widely reported and GoPro still hasn't fixed it yet.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We're in the Maldives for our once in a lifetime vacation and our brand new GoPro HERO4 isn't working!,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We tested it out twice before leaving for our trip and it started freezing up as soon as we landed in the Maldives.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,":( Thankfully our hotel has internet, so we tried all of the troubleshooting steps on GoPro's website to no avail.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera freezes up even without a SD card inserted, so we believe it's a bad camera.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We reached out to GoPro support with a detailed email of issues (including the fact that we're using one of their recommended micro SD cards) and that it freezes up even without a SD card inserted.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"GoPro support responded with 'From the information you have provided, I would say, not for sure yet, that the problem is your SD card, can you please send us a photo to check which one you have.'",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Seriously?,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,We bought the GoPro specifically to take underwater footage of our scuba adventures here.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Now we have nothing to document this trip we've saved up for/planned for the past 5 years!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,So disheartened.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,:(,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,My first GoPro.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Haven't tested underwater but any video or photo I've shot I've really liked.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Changing settings on the touch screen is easy; I can't imagine the difficulty with other/previous versions that don't have that option.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Speaking of options, that's one downside I've found.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,There are many (for a novice) to choose from.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I find myself missing or delaying moments because I'm trying to decide what video or photo mode to use.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I understand I'll learn with practice but to me the GoPro's appeal is it's ability to capture 'in the moment' and I think I've missed some of those while fiddling with 'super-wide at 1080p 60fps or medium 1440 48fps?',"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4,type decisions.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"When I use my camera with Wifi on, there is a pulsing audio sound captured in the recording.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,A quick Google search reveals this was a widely known problem by that GoPro was aware of at least a year before I bought by camera.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It has been 18 months since I bought my camera.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Today is the first time I used the Wifi and I discovered the problem.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Even though it's past the warranty period, I'm going to submit a warranty claim to GoPro.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I'll update my review if they make it right and fix my camera or send me a new one.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"If they won't take care of what was a known issue before they sold me my camera because I didn't submit a warranty claim within 12 months, I'll never use their products again.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It's a shame because I was happy with this product until I found this out today.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This is a great video camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The film quality is pretty amazing as you can tell by all the other reviews.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The only issue we have are that the sound capture is not great if you have the case on and it is mounted.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,You tend to get lots of squeaking in the joint area that can make the sound suck.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I guess that why all the Go Pro videos have music added to them.,6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Also this is not that good for still pixs.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,We tend to go back to our Iphone for still pics.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Works somewhat as promised.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Takes great pictures and videos.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Mounts to just about everything I'd want it to.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Has serious problems syncing and staying synced to my iPhone 6 plus.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Syncs immediately the first time, then refuses to sync after either phone or Hero4 goes to sleep.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Must go through extensive turning on and off to get it to start working with the iPhone again.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"NOT GOOD when I'm in the middle of skiing, bicycling or hiking.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The last thing I want to do is tech support.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,This is the only way I can tell if I have it pointed at the right elevation.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I took video of an entire bike trip with the camera tipped too far down because the GoPro would not sync with the iPhone and I couldn't tell how it was pointed.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Its ok.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery drains fast.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Also didnt come with gopro cd like other gopros do.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,My dad ordered his gopro from amazon and still got the cd even tho it wasnt listed.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Took this baby on our overseas vacation and it worked great!,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,We have great underwater videos and action photos/videos.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's durable, light, and easy to  carry everywhere.",1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Tried to use as an indoor camera in low lighting and found out that wasn't the optimal condition for this camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Definitely an outdoor camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It came with a head mount and chest mount that we didn't really have a use for.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Bought a separate monopod for the GoPro which we used 90% of the time.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love that you can preview the pictures and videos and delete unwanted pics/vids before wasting time uploading them.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It takes some great fisheye videos and yes the battery sucks.,1,"C,P",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I'm sure you read this elsewhere.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,What annoys me the most is that it uses USB mini instead of micro.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Now it's another cable to carry around.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Open the camera connected it to my phone.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Camera tried to install latest software over WiFi but was not able to install.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Called Go-pro for help and was assisted with a manual install that did not help.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Go-pro then wanted me to complete the warranty and replace the unit I had.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I am returning this product if this is my first introduction to their product and it could not work then I do not want to own this.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Love it so far.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Square lens had some dust on the inside which I noticed after taking a few sample videos and pictures and viewing them on the computer.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Took a Q-tip and cleaned dust out the best I can without removing the square housing lens.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Better but not perfect like it should be.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Camera without housing is crystal clear.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Would have given it 5 stars if quality control was better for the housing.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,May be a defect in the flat glass.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It's unbelievable how much is packed into this tiny camera... Technology is really something.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"However, GoPro dominates this market and thus can charge whatever they want.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"At this price point, you'd expect your gear to not freeze up regularly, batteries to last for more than a few hours, etc... 4 stars simply because it is a great product...","1,2,3","C,R",Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,But GoPro needs to do better.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Because of difficulties in sending the camera received on Wednesday 15 April.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Following the instructions of the camera, loaded the battery and put the micro sd 32 gb class 10 brand Samsung.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera turns on but the screen does not transmit anything from the lens and when menus are manipulated application hangs and does not respond, so you have to turn it off or remove the battery.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I need to know how you will resolve this issue me because the product is under warranty for one year.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It was acquired by Amazon according to the order No.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"109-0544668-4118645, which was delivered to the warehouse in Miami, USA.",4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,The order indicates that the product is sold by: Amazon.com LLC.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The manufacturer Gopro already been reported under Case #: 01202790.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"After receiving response procedure to solve the problem, could change my opinion and product qualification.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The battery was not inside of the gopro box, so I couldn't take any picture","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Way too much hype for this camera.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Mediocre at best.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"What is there to say... it's a GoPro, it's awesome!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Yes there are much cheaper options available out there that are advertised as similar, but if you're serious about shooting quality videos spend your money on this.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I prefer the LCD touchscreen so the silver was the best option for me.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The option to control your GoPro through the phone app is really neat too!,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Stupid camera battery dies in 1.5 hours usually, have to keep switching them out all the time.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Also some of the video I recorded got randomly corrupted by itself, even though I was using expensive memory cards.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Bought this for my hubby for Christmas.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,He loves it and took it on a fishing excursion.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Big plans for use for fishing trips.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The head mount allows for almost hands free operation.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Set up seemed easy and he was up and running with little difficulty.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Photos and videos are fantastic for such a small camera and will transfer to your iPad or iPhone via bluetooth.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Great for the techie!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Pros- The GoPro Hero4 Silver produces some great video for an action cam.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Its great resolution and frame-rate options will satisfy beginners (me) and experienced shooters.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The built-in touchscreen makes previewing and reviewing and changing settings a breeze.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,You can get the app and use it as a remote when it connects to the gopro.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Cons- It still needs a housing to be waterproof and the battery redesign means you can't use your old batteries and battery life will still be too short for some especially when you keep the touch screen display on (it drains the battery even more).,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,No option for in-camera digital image stabilization.,2,C,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Over all I am happy with the purchase and the handy new features including a touchscreen, makes it one of the best little action cameras around.","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Loved the idea of videoing my trip to Boundary Waters, but camera got damp (not wet) and hasn't worked since.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Not sure what to do about it.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Shipping & packaging were fine,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,New to Go Pro and was excited to get the camera.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Just received the camera and out of the box the touchscreen had 25% dead pixels along one side of the screen.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Will return through Amazon, hope for the best with the replacement.",4,,,

B00NIYJF6U,2,"Having nothing but trouble with the WIFI, Amazon won't take it back, I may have to fight about this one","1,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I purchased a new GoPro.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,This came in a package that had been open and package torn and very worn on the corners.,7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I sent it back immediately.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Great product, my only concern is the waterproof housing isn't 100% waterproof.","1,3",I,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Still awesome would recommend it to everyone.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Best when purchased with the smart remote and go pole.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I did a ton of research before buying this camera and was aware of the many reports of the hero4 silver freezing and becoming completely unresponsive.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"It seems from the reports I've read, that the solution in every case was to ship thing to gopro under warranty and they replace it and maybe you will get a good one.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I thought just maybe I would get a good one since they have been out a while now.... Nope.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,nothing but issues.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My SD card is officially supported and is one of the fast cards you can buy today.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Rather than jack with shipping back and forth and dealing with the hassle of that whole mess, I just returned the dang thing to Amazon and went to my local Best Buy to get one and hope for the best.","4,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Well, the one from Best Buy has tested great so far.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I guess it's just a roll of the dice with this model.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I figured if i got another bad one it would much easier to just go back to the local store.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,top latch broke in a month of light use,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Video is great.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"But if you take photo, the photo quality is really not as good as I expect.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I think the photo quality is worse than my Galaxy Note 4.,"1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Considering the high price tag, I give it 3 stars.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"(BTW, GPro stock is only $12 now.)",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Does everything I want and need as advertised.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Doesn't replace a point and shoot camera for getting landscape shots, but excellent for action video, wide angle landscape shots, selfie shots, and time lapses.","3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Gopro editing software leaves a bit to be desired but the camera is exactly what you expect.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have had it for about 6 months and have taken it on my dirtbike helmet for some trails and fields, strapped it to the exoskeleton of a buddy's off road vehicle for some river trails and rock climbs, put it on the dash when we rented a car overseas and got some sweet time lapse video, and carried it on several hikes and a few other adventures.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Wouldn't have been able to do most of these with any other camera.,5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,LCD does make framing easier.,1,P,,

B00NIYJF6U,1,Clearly not a hero 4,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Love this thing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for scuba diving with red filters.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"What I like most is I no longer spend time getting the perfect shot, I just take a video and crop a picture out of the video.","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It makes diving much more pleasant for me and my dive buddies, no more kicking coral or separating from the group.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"You don't need an extension stick, just get a hand held wand.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I am a pilot, and I am using it to video my flights.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"It is costly for a camera, and low battery life, and somewhat more complicated than expected, but getting past that, a handy tool for filming activities.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Very choppy,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Delivery was prompt but prior to even opening up the standard plastic housing, I could see a scratch over the lens area.",7,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,After opening up the housing I could confirm that the scratch was on the camera lens itself - and it was a deep scratch.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Either GoPro lacks proper product inspection processes or it had already been returned and they tried to pawn it off to an unsuspecting new buyer.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I didn't need to buy it online so I'm wondering why I did.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll return it and buy one from a brick & mortar retailer where I can visually inspect it first; probably a good practice for all pricy electronics.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I returned the Hero 4 Black and got this one instead.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The battery life is still not the greatest but this camera has the Built-In Touch Display (hint, reason why the Silver is not great on battery life), which makes it 100 times easier to use than the Black version.",1,"C,P",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The display is very easy to use and pictures quality is really nice.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I still think these GoPro cameras are over priced but I like this one a lot.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Cannot wait to use it for snorkeling in South Florida!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I received the camera a couple of days ago and was happy with the condition, that is until I charged the product and turned it on.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera kept freezing on me and has glitches on the images.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Just think about watching snow on a TV and that's what you have with the screen display.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Not happy with this purchase at all.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"The camera worked perfectly for 4 months, then it freezes and you are not able to take pictures.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I have purchased two different microSD cards from the Gopro recommended list and updated the camera firmware.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"Really disappointed with the product and the worst is that I have missed really great shots during different trips, because the camera simply freezes.","1,3",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I LOVE the Hero4 Silver.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I had a GoPro Hero but wanted to upgrade to something a little better to take to horse shows and on trail rides.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It is perfect!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I have taken it swimming, to multiple countries, and on some wild adventures.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,It has held up with 0 problems.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,Just remember to save battery life by turning the LCD screen off.,"1,6",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I will be purchasing a second one soon!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"First of all as an owner of old Hero 2 series, this new series is beyond compare.","4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The challenge was to chose between black and silver edition but now I am very satisfied with my choice for silver edition since; - Too much investment needed to play and edit 4K films and I am not quite sure whether the difference between 4K and 1920x1080 is that significant especially if there is no TV and/or monitor capable of showing 4K - Silver edition very slim and its back built in LCD panel is perfect and for black edition you have to pay another 80.- USD,"1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Won't work with any of my micro sd cards and didn't come with one.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Worked for 2 months and started freezing.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Now i am dealing with GoPro support team for an exchange and missing out on capturing the moments for which i paid this money.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I bought the GoPro Hero 4 Silver and I have never been more disappointed in a product!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,The camera keeps freezing up even after updating the firmware severally.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I send my complaint to gopro and they have asked me to send it back for an exchange only problem is that I am in Nigeria and I will probably be charged AGAIN for custom fees.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I wish I didnt buy the damn thing!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Don't make the same mistake I did!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Battery Life and Remote are problems Camera and video seem to fit my needs, but the battery life is only good for 1-2 hours not much use if you want to capture something on film that may not happen right away and don't bring extra batteries (think of a fishing trip).",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,The wi-fi remote is terrible as far as charging holding a charge 1 star or lower if there were such a rating.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"My experience with the remote has lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 and could go lower depending on GoPro's technical support, I guess I find out what kind of company I'm dealing with soon.","1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Buyer beware.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,For many this camera freezes up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"I used my successfully 1x and the next time that I wanted to use the camera, it freezes and will do nothing.","1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,1,I followed Go Pro instructions to try and solve the issue and no success.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,Be sure to check out Youtube videos on the number of people who have had this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,It is a great little camera if you do not get a lemon.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1,"If you do, you are stuck with it if out of warranty so be sure and get the warranty rather than be out $400.00.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have purchased two of these cameras and neither one of them worked for external audio.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I have a drawer full of microphones and microphone adapters and none of them work.,"1,2,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I recently purchased a Drift ghost S it has a 3.5 mm microphone Jack on it no need for an adapter I do not know why GoPro can't build their cameras the same.,"3,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The video is excellent though but not being able to run a microphone into my helmet is a problem for me.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I purchased the GoPro HERO4 Silver for my wedding videography business at the beginning of the wedding season.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I was reluctant, because I had heard mixed reviews and I wasn't sure how it would fit into my business necessarily.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I decided to give it a chance, and it was one of the best business decisions I've ever made!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"This camera is an absolute blast, and something that I've recommended time and time again to friends and family.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We use several HD cameras while shooting wedding footage, and I was concerned about the quality of the GoPro not stacking up..",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I was pleasantly surprised, and to be honest blown away by the quality of this compact camera!","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We've had a great time with it, and utilize it for the difficult shots!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,We've also recently started handing off the GoPro to members of the wedding party to take on the dance floor to capture some dancing footage!,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"We would have NEVER dreamed of handing off our equipment, but the GoPro is so indestructible we feel confident we can share it!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Our clients love that we've started doing this, because it adds a great perspective and we love that clients feel comfortable using the camera!","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's so user friendly, we never have to explain it to anyone!",2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,5,They generally just have a sense of how to use it right away!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I've used the GoPro on several hikes, kayaking, and on various adventures!",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I'm so impressed by this company, and I would love to have 5 more GoPros!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"I would recommend this to parents wanting to start their kids off with a great / fun camera, serious adventurous looking for a camera that is up for the challenge, photographers, videographers, filmmakers!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Basically, anyone looking for a great investment and something that will hold up!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"It's a tiny camera, but incredible power!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,So impressed!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Good for underwater photography, OK for video.","1,3",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The case does not have a eyelet for securing the lanyard found on the red lens (used for better colors when diving) which seems bizarre considering how much this thing costs.,1,"C,R",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Hence the outer case needs some work.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,This will not go into night mode automatically when going from outside a wreck to inside the wreck...a costly lesson for a Gopro noob like me.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I got this a few days before an overseas diving trip and the printed material provided is kinda crappy.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Yea, I know go online...well in a developing country that is easier said than done.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I simple sheet explaining basic functionality would have be great, but the Gopro gerus don't think so.","3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,They would rather spend money on fancy packaging.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Go online...yea try that overseas.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It works good on land as well.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"It takes okay photos, but nothing spectacular.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Lack of zoom is disappointing.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Video is great, as is the underwater capability.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,I only gave it three stars  because the outer case scratches EXTREMELY easily.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I've had several sport-type underwater cameras over the years, and never had one that looked so bad after one week of use.","1,5",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I am a casual snorkeler, and it was in a case when not in use.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,There is no way a 'sports' camera should look this bad after a week of light use.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I love this thing.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I was really reluctant to buy one because I am not going to strap a camera to a bicycle or my head or anything like that.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I use it for the family and I am very happy.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,The size and video quality is great and I carry it almost everywhere.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"If I have any complaint is that if you want to use it outside the housing, it is not well protected, and it is easy to accidentally get finger prints on the lens.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,I bought a metal protective housing that includes a UV filter and lens cap that makes me feel a little safer.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,5,"Again, I am really happy with the product overall and will most assuredly buy future models.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,What to say about these cameras...The video quality is really good as we can see everywhere in youtube and having a display really helps fine tune the camera position.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,As the display  turns off after 1 minute it won't drain all the battery.,2,,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"The only con is the sound noises caused by the camera shaking inside the box, it could have something already installed out of the factory to avoid these shocks so I wouldn't need to worry about putting something in there to fix it.",1,"C,R",,
B00NIYJF6U,4,It just doesn't fell right to install rubbers and sponges on a brand new camera case to have any chance to use the sounds captured by the Hero4 Silver..,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,The good thing about gopros are there versatility.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Built in screen is great in this!,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,4k is only fps so just think of it as no 4k.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I always film at 1080p at 60fps.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Having the appropriate mounts and cases for your use are important.,1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,I would spend ~100 additional on those and extra batteries and charger.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"to take filming to the next level, get a feiyu tech g4 gimbal.",5,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Everything is there, except for the waterproof housing even though it was advertised under the features and details and was also shown in the picture.",8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"Needs image stabilization badly, End up with the Sony version because of this.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Picture quality was ok.,1,P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Product gets very warm when using for some reason.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,Battery life is not great.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,3,"I can see the appeal for some with this product, but it was lacking some very key features found in comparably priced products,","2,3",,Information Giving,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"I love my Go Pro, just wish the battery lasted longer and had a flash.",1,R,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Make sure your computer can handle the high resolution settings, otherwise you may not be able to watch your videos unless you record them with the 720 setting.",6,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,Most newer computers can handle the 1080P just fine.,"4,5",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4,"Older computers, not so well.","5,8",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Hi GoPro team, I'm really sad because my camera was damage since the first day.","1,4",O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"I could take some photos, not good at all because the camera began to be blocked, the screen was black and the buttons didn't work.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I had high expectations because I was going to use it the first time in a trip but it was a bad experience.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Would it be possible to have a support contact to fix it or have a new camera or have my money back.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Please let me know any comment or a photo or video as a support.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,My mail is dca134@gmail.com Thank you!,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Diana Ariza,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I bought the GoPro 4 Silver with the idea in mind that I was buying the best camera of this type available.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,It turned out that it's a nightmare to set up and just didn't deliver on picture quality.,2,C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"Note that this camera only downloads wirelessly, that's one point not made in all the tutorials and advertisements never mentioned.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"The GoPro App download was different for different iPads I had, and totally wrong for one of them.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Couldn't connect wirelessly.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,"In general, I can't recommend buying this camera to anyone who can't spend two or three days messing around with it to get it to work...and maybe a few more days to get it to work properly...if at all.",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I was so stoked to buy a GOPRO camera because they are supposed to be rugged.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Well I wouldnt know because I havent taken mine outside yet and it is already broken.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I started to get these pink lines in the LCD screen and then it just freezes up.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,2,You have to remove the battery to turn it off.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I figure no big deal its brand new I'll just send it back.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,When my new one arrives it is doing the same thing after about 3 hours.,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I am now waiting on my  3rd camera in the mail.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,GOPRO has excellent tech support and sent me a new camera right away so we will see what happens next but.... All I can tell you is that make sure you get a micro SD card from GOPRO's recommended list.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,The speed of the card is very important.,1,O,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'm not sure if my card corrupted both cameras (which i have never heard of before) or if I got 2 faulty cameras so far.,"1,4",I,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I ordered a new sandisk extreme 64 gig card to try with my new camera.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Fingers crossed.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Not that it really matters.,8,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,the vacation I bought this camera for came and went a month ago.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,Before you buy this camera Google GoPro freezing problems....,"3,4",,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'm not the only one with this problem.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,2,I'll update this review to let you know how it all plays out.,8,,,
