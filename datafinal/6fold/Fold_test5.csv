B01J24C0TI,2,Seriously?,8,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"It is like a running ad (Try 'Alexa, find albums by Billy Joel').",2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,2,Does Billy get a cut from this crap?,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,I bought it mainly to keep up with technology and this does nothing for me.,"3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,2,I am sure there will be improvements in time.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,I bought it to replace a Sony Dash that is no longer supported.,4,,,

B01J24C0TI,4,I like the hardware but I think the Software needs some more work & improvements.,"1,2",P,Feature Request,

B01J24C0TI,5,We love The Echo Show!,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,Our granddaughters were moving away so we bought 2 and sent one with them.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,Being able to have them call us and see their sweet little faces is a major plus.,6,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,"It does every once in awhile spout out something when no one is near, but we figured it out, It was a fruit fly that would land on the screen.It is kind of funny because I was talking in the back of the house and she says I have added Shower Bagels to your list.",4,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,Over all i fantastic purchase,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,This is my third Echo-- and I only added this to monitor a nest cam in my child's room without leaving my phone on all night.,"4,6",,,
B01J24C0TI,1,The Echo Show is a poor substitute.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,The screen constantly goes grey and displays 'Buffering...' and then the live video randomly just shuts down and the Show returns to a home screen.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,USELESS.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Clearly a beta product.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,This is certainly an upgade from the first round of echo products!,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,"Amazon could improve things a bit with a suggested list of commands that will work from the get go but, otherwise easy to set up and use.",2,,Feature Request,

B01J24C0TI,3,Looks like a small projection TV.,"1,5",O,,

B01J24C0TI,5,I waited to buy an Echo for the last couple of years and the Echo Show has exceeded my expectations.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,You will not be dissapoinred with this devices capabilities!,2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,3,"This is a great upgrade from the original Echo, however, there are a couple annoyances and lost opportunities that I hope will be addressed in software updates.",2,,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,3,"First, rotating suggestions about how you can use Echo appear on the screen.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,3,"They even appear while the Show is doing other things, like on the 'now playing' screen while playing music.",2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,3,"There is a setting to control them, but you can't get rid of them completely.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,3,"They are very distracting and unnecessary for some people, and I wish you could turn them off.",2,,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,3,"Next, I'm not convinced that the sound is as good as the original, and there is no way to control the speaker bass or treble.",1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,3,"Lastly, there is no option to display a simple monthly calendar on the screen.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,3,"These are issues that I'm sure Amazon can address, and overall I am enjoying the Show, and it is definitely worth the extra cost over the Echo.",3,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,This sleek device was essential this weekend.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,My wife and I recently acquired a beach house.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,Not only did it prove to be the center of conversation with a number of family and friends but having a screen to watch Amazon Prime Movies kept the two kids entertained as we haven't had an opportunity to get a TV.,"3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,5,When the children weren't watching; the adults had as much fun pumping the tunes (mostly reggae and beach themed music).,"3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,5,As a side note suggested to a brother-in-law that our mother-in-law could benefit from an Echo as her fingers are gnarled with rheumatoid arthritis.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,Being able to call out 'call Donna' would provide a semblance of control and connection.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,5,Now I'm getting familiar with using the Show to slideshow pictures via Amazon Drive Storage.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"Would be a great device, but there is a very annoying 'try this' message you can't get to go away.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,"While you are playing music it will have something on the screen that says 'try this, ask alexa to play a game'  or 'try this, tell alexa to turn up the volume'.",2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,2,Makes it look cheap and I already know these things so I would like to be able to turn off notifications.,"2,4",,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,2,Please Amazon!,7,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,We like it very much so far it's been our expectations we kind of wish it was a little more of a modern design it seems a little bulky and clunky but other than that it is a nice device and seems to work well,"1,3","C,R",,
B01J24C0TI,3,Most of the timr no response,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,not worth the money it does the same stuff the other echo did i cant believe i got rid off the other device and put more money for it.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,Its... ok...,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,I think as more features come in to play it will be better not many of the skills are designed around the video screen right now,2,,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,2,Very unhappy overall with the Echo Show.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,I purchased at Best Buy and used it for about 20 days.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,My conclusion: Going to return it.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,I like the idea of having a screen but the execution is terrible.,"1,2",P,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,"For example, the Echo Show displays rotating news stories and underneath says 'Alexa, tell me about X' to hear more about the story.",4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,Asking Alexa about those stories almost NEVER works.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,"Other clunky interface examples: When listening to music, I like the idea of showing lyrics but it doesnt actually tell you what song you are listening to on the same screen?","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,How dumb is that?,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,Very dissapointed in the product and will be returned.,"3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Worked  great with phone connection.,2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,4,Still learning  of many other things sure as music.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"Having owned all the echo products to this point, I just couldn't find any way the show added to the equation.","3,5",,,
B01J24C0TI,2,Tried it in kitchen but angle to view it was awkward.,"1,4",C,,
B01J24C0TI,2,In bedroom it was no better as an alarm clock than the dot.,"3,5",,,
B01J24C0TI,2,It also had a much larger footprint than it appears in the photos.,1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"A few years back there was the chumby and Sony dash, they had more available to them then this does now.",5,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"I'm sure amazon will get it right either the second or third generation, but not yet",4,,,
B01J24C0TI,3,It's a good product but not as loud in volume as the echo.,"1,3",C,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Echo Show is awsome still needs a little work and could use some more uses but other then that this thing makes life easier alot more fun Once you get a hue bulb your wallet will be empty haha :) hope this helps,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,1,Not much different than the amazon echo.,5,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Yes it has a display but the use cases are limited.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,"For instance, I can only watch a few Amazon shows and to do this I must enable this skill.",4,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Each show is a skill.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,There are only a few shows.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,On top of that the device is buggy.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,YouTube videos will not play.,5,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Long lines of code appear on the display on the home screen and in Youtube.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,One of the pros is you can now see what you are buying.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,1,But I'd rather use a computer so I can compare prices at other stores.,"4,5",,,
B01J24C0TI,4,"The Good - Great screen, nice visuals and still does everything an Echo has in the past and more.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,4,The Bad - I feel a bit of bait & switch here because some of its coolest features like displaying song lyrics or even something as simple as having a folder of wallpapers on shuffle are for Prime Members only.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,4,"I feel that if you are not a Prime Member, you only get to enjoy about 1/2 of what the device can do.",4,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,I wish more of the 'good stuff' were available to everyone who shelled out $225 for the device and not just for those who continue to give Amazon money monthly.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,3,Disappointed in the sound - I expected it to match up to the sound of a Bose radio and it does not.,1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,3,Weak and a bit tinny.,1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,3,Alexa also seems to have some difficulty finding songs in my Amazon music library.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,5,"We can workout together but don't have the long drive to each others house which saves us a ton of time, trying to get together for workouts after work.",4,,,

B01J24C0TI,5,:-) Had no issues with it so far.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,5,So  - no complaints :-),3,,,

B01J24C0TI,5,"Some day, when I have a spare day, I'd like to wear  Alexa out with requests.",4,,,

B01J24C0TI,4,"The interface is sometimes puzzling in trying to figure how to accomplish specific tasks, for example after pausing a prime video and going to the home screen, it isn't necessarily intuitive how to return to the video.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,4,Maybe an icon of what is active could appear when paused.,2,,Feature Request,
B01J24C0TI,4,I'm sure more capabilities are in the works.,2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,2,I decided to return my Show.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,"It looses contact with the wireless network, which is located about 4 feet from the Show on a regular basis.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2,And I cant figure out how to change the network or reset the thing.,2,,Inquiry,
B01J24C0TI,2,"I have 6 regular echos and am  very happy with the however this device, at least for me, is not worth the price of several standard echos.","3,5",,,

B01J24C0TI,4,Thank you Amazon for not following the Apple model.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,It is appreciated!,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,The calendar sync with Outlook was the main reason we bought one.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,1,Unfortunately it was unable to sync in either direction with Outlook on my iPhone 7+.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1,The issue was escalated to the development team but have not received any update in a week so I returned the unit.,4,,,

B01J24C0TI,4,Haven't spent much time using it but that will change in the future.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,At that point I will let you know.,8,,,
B01J24C0TI,2,This product is severly limited in its ability to interact with the outside world because it must have an 'external app' in order to be set up and used for more then an alarm clock,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,4,Everything about this device is speculator.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Only reason it gets just 4 stars is the angle of the camera.,1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,4,It points up too high for proper facial capture.,1,C,,
B01J24C0TI,4,Otherwise it is a KILLER!,3,,,
