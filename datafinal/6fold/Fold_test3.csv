B01LRLJV28,1,"After owning Sony consoles since the PS1 was launched over 20 years ago, the fact that PS4 gutted the ability for my $300 Harmony remote to turn it on for movie watching (and redid the control scheme to make even this simple task utterly unintuitive)--now that my Sony brand controllers have started lagging to render games nearly unplayable, I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that non-PC gaming is becoming worthless.Good job Sony, you managed to murder a cash cow.","1,2,4,5,6",C,Problem Discovery,

B01LRLJV28,2,It did not work correctly.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,It would turn on and a fuzzy white screen would keep coming up,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,The wireless card in this thing is junk.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"As of this review,I have had the system for less than 3 months and it has completely died (as in 'cash in that warranty, send it back to customer service' died) twice.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I've had an Xbox One for 2 years and haven't had a single problem - save yourself the frustration and get an Xbox instead.,"3,5",,,

B01LRLJV28,3,"i got the original day 1 ps4 console cuh-1000, so im comparing the new slim to this one.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"pros: its a ps4 in a beautiful and smaller console, much better controller that you can set to usb instead of bluetooth, improved wifi compared to day 1 ps4, 65w consumption playing destiny on digital form versus 108w from the original ps4, it weight a lot of less than the original, hdmi included, usb to connect the controller included.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"cons: still a lot of noise from the fan and it doesn't have a optical sound port (so i could not connect my soundbar via this port), problems with very old hdmi TVs (the original connect just fine), headset looks like it will break soon but 3 stars because it doesn't have a optical port if you don't care about that then this is the best deal on the block.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Good,3,,,

B01LRLJV28,2,"Nothing else wrong with the console, but still very disappointing.",1,C,,

B01LRLJV28,3,The graphics are phenomenal.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The whole system is really great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,But I have a HUGE problem.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,We have 2 wireless headsets that will not work with this because there is no optical port on the this.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"It is on the PS4 & PS3, but Sony apparently didn't think about it when they made the Slim.","1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"So, now I have to either purchase 2 more headsets that do not require the optical cord (at least $200) or buy a converter box ($25-$50).","1,5",C,,

B01LRLJV28,5,I spend as much time with this as I do with my wife.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,played for 5 days and it has corrupted data file,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,It's only been 6 months and the Playstation had already started to turn off randomly.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,It was fun while it lasted.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Just as expected and super fast shipping!,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Great value as a package set.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Uncharted 4 is an excellent conclusion to the Drake series.,3,,,

B01LRLJV28,4,I only minus 1 star because  I hate that  Playstation  doesnt do backward compatibility.,2,,Problem Discovery,(example of compalints)
B01LRLJV28,4,I have tons of ps3 games that are now coasters because our ps3 stopped working.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,4,I like the new slim design and it doesnt seem to run as hot as  my previous  system.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"This bundle came with uncharted 4 game, which  was great.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,We already completed  the game and it was very fun.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It also came with 1 wireless remote.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,These new remotes  are great and fit my hands a vit better than the previous  version.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The fact that they removed the optical audio output from this device is confounding.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,It's included on the basic PS4 and the Pro version.,"3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Without the audio output it's virtually impossible to connect to a PC speaker system (tried a number of work arounds involving DACS, etc.).","1,5",C,,

B01LRLJV28,3,Was a bit a frustrated as I ordered this as a gift for my Husband and Son and didn't realise firstly there are regional restrictions and secondly there is a monthly membership needed to get extra content etc.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I was sent a code to enter for a free year PS4 membership but the system won't accept the code and finding someway to email someone for help proved very difficult.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Also when it arrived it came with a USA plug, the fact that is was being shipped to an Irish address didn't give a hint to the seller that a USA plug would not work :( - I feel sorry for any parent that ordered this as a Christmas gift, only to find this one on the day.","1,4",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Luckily we happened to have an adapter that we were able to take off something else and put on this otherwise they would have been really upset.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I think this should have been clearly stated or an adapter included in packages shipped overseas It is all set up now and working fine but looking back now I wish I had just bought this from a local store,3,,,

B01LRLJV28,3,The PS4 came in good condition but the uncharted 4 game does not work.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It freezes every time I try to play it,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"The product is fine, the seller excellent, the only problem are the restrictions to my country (Guatemala), it's like I payed with dust or beans, why we do not have youtube app and otters, we pay you sony with money for that reason we deserve the same benefits of all.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Produced stated that it was to come with Uncharted 4 and it didn't.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,There wasn't a single game within the package.,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Would like some resolution tof this immediately,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I purchased the PS4 Slim for one game... MLB: The Show.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The console disappoints.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's design put style over practicality.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The plastic feels cheap.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The venting for air flow is inadequate.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's noisy.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Of all the PlayStations over the years, I'm surprised the latest one is my least favorite.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,For the price and what I received was pleased.My nine year old son was very happy and he purchased his extra contoller and five games with his Christmas money and Game Stop gift cards.,"3,4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Worked for a month and now it won't accept any discs.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Idk how the hell to send it in for repair.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Seems faulty, stops working and needs reset after just 30 mins of play.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,Charger cords broke with in 2 weeks,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I upgrade the drive to a 2TB unit.,"1,4",O,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Went very smooth.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Love the games and apps on this.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,Great graphics and lots of popular PS4-only games out there.,2,,Information Giving,

B01LRLJV28,5,I didn't know what I was buying.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,My son wanted this for Christmas and Cyber Monday was my saviour!!!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Got it on time as described but the look on my son's face when he opened the box and realized that it was the slim version was priceless!!!!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I have a VERY happy kid!!!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Got here in 3 days, box a some dings on it as pictured, but everything inside was in perfect shape.","4,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Hooked up and working great so far.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Would be 5 stars if it would have been here sooner.,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Still a great deal,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"I rarely ever buy used products, let alone used entertainment consoles, so when this arrived at my home, I was suprised and extremely elated.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"My ps4 came with everything it was supposed to come with, along with the fact that my ps4 is like new.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Being completely honest— the only 'used' feature I found, was that Black Ops 3 was already downloaded on the game.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Other than at the thing was completely new.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It's a great console for a great price you will really get the deal out of this one!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Recommend it!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I can't believe that you can't play any ps 1 or 2 games,and not even PS3 games.You can't copy music videos pictures from a usb to the hard drive unbelievable!You can't even play the games you purchased on the PlayStation 3 store what the hell?","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"PS3 when it first came out it played everything from its previous consoles and it had 4 USB slots 3 card readers, this is a joke!","1,3,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Uncharted game doesnt work but fast shipping an new as described,"2,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,The HDMI did not work.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Only audio was playing when I connected it to my monitor.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Later tried with a different HDMI cable and that worked perfectly.,"1,4",P,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This is something that is not expected out of a SONY product.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"The system was said to be new, however when I turned it on there was already a user account there.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,That is false advertisement.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"The system must be used, therefore I should be entitled to at least a partial refund.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"The device is fine, however, the PSN is getting crap day by day; No new games, no backward compatible; expensive subscriptions and crap deals, glitchy transaction system.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,The case construction seems ok but the cable quality provided with this is cheap like chinese ones on ebay.,1,"P,C",,
B01LRLJV28,2,Controller does not hold charge for long.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The interface is so lame that I call it just an update of PS3 not an upgrade.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I own XboX as well and this cheap thing is nowhere near to XboX construction, service, items, interface quality.","1,2,3,4",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I really loved the killzone and uncharted series and wanted to play the latest ones, no new killzone is coming up and uncharted has become lame as drake has been retired completely; I find no reason to keep this wasting my space.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I do not recommend this junk from japan (unless you're an indie lover),3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"It's ok... between Playstations plus and Microsofts Xbox Live: Xbox wins hands down with more content, easier access to content and overall value.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Not impressed with PS4...,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I will be going back to my Xbox One now (4 free games a month with their service).,"4,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"My system has a black screen problem, the visual and audio will randomly go out completely (most when i just turn it on after not using it for a day or two).",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"It happened a lot when i just got the system, not so much these days.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I still haven't found the reason for this, however i usually plug out the HDMI and plug it in again.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,USB port is faulty,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The order came a late.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,But the PS4 is working as expected.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Got it for $220 With uncharted4.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Never owned a playstation but it's working great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Hell of a deal,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Just like description.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Nothing wrong during shipping.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Came on time.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Very nice console,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Stopped working after only 3.5 months.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Originally, as a gamer i don't like going out of my 'comfort zone' when it comes to buying new games, but i must say, i got so addicted to uncharted that i ended up buying the first 3 uncharted's, the playstation itself, ofcourse, works as intended, i still have it to this day and use it daily","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate the business policies behind consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate the monetization of consoles.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I hate console exclusives.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,BUT there are some PlayStation ONLY games this gen that I'm not passing on just because I think this is a $250 crappy media machine with games that are more expensive than their counterparts on PC and a monthly subscription required to be able to do 1/2 of the things.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,This is the most affordable way to reliably get into the playstation ecosystem.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I did not like it much because I thought that the console brought with the game of Uncharted 4, can explain to me what happened, if it really came with the game or not, I would like to be told to leave the doubt.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This really deserves a half of a star.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I paid for a console and game bundle, and only recieved the console.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,There was no game physically present.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I expected a little bit of a roughed up console (superficial scratches in the console) or a very poor box.,"4,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Instead, i just get a console with a game downloaded on there that requires a physical disc to be in the console in ordered to be played.","4,6",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I did get a refund after going through customer service of a decent chunk of my purchase; more than enough to go out to a gamestop and buy the game.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,That alone is worth another star.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,What really bugs me is the seal of approval by amazon on the box stating that everything in this box is good to go and be sold.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I hope that amazon reps read this review and take it for what its worth.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I am a forst time user of this service, and now i am disinclined to use it again.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Bought the same product twice and both times was defective.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This is supposed to play DVD's as well as Blue Ray disk.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The blue ray disk get stuck every time you try to play one.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I bought this item because I wanted to use all the features but was unable to do so.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,So I guess they can keep it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I been using PS console since 1996, i got them all, and i know this is an electronic product and it going to fail at some point.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,my PS3 last for like 6 years with no problem and the same with the other console.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I bought this as a gift from me to myself but it fail seven months later.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I use it regularly but dont abuse it.Actually i bought the cooler base.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Im not a hardcore gamer, I play for like 2 hours before work, and watch Netflix and other TV apps for like 2 hours at night before sleep.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,So dont know whats gone wrong.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Well, only 3 stars because its the first time a have problem with one of the PS console, my first slim one.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I do kinda regret getting a PS4 as the exclusives are nothing special at this moment but I am interested in Yakuza 0, FF7 remake, and several other titles.","3,5",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Everything else, I play on PC.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The console will get hot so I strongly recommend getting a base that has fans to help cool it off and help preserve the lifespan of the HDD as well as internal components.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It took a while to ship it but it arrived no problem.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Bad product!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"Since I got the ps4, it started to shut it down or the image disappear, the hdmi has no signal sometimes.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,"(Sorry about my English) I'm from Ecuador so I can't returne this defective machine, I think it is a refurbished one, I don't know.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"But I losse my money on this, I was very excited to get one, but now I'm very disappointed.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"In the US $260 is cheap, in my country I had to work 1 month to get that amount.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Will never buy again,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,3,U4 game not aviable in the box,"7,8",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Once I did the update with the game...when the patch was downloaded the game would just get stuck at the opening and give no message.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,I tried everything a little disappointing considering the bundle was $249.00 The issue I believe is only with the game and the associated update.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,4,Good stuff!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Switches off by its self everytime i play for like 20 minutesand then it asks me to report prob which i dont even know,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,It states a abundle but only received the game.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Very unprofessional.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,was a great gift,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Love the console.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,It's really a good deal.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,The PlayStation 4 slim has a really nice design that allows a horizontal and vertical placement.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,The slim offers all the same options and characteristics as the regular one.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,The storage off 500GB is enough to download 5 to 6 games new generation.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,And the game uncharted 4 was really good.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,Mind blowing graphics and an awesome soundtrack.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,

B01LRLJV28,3,Came very well packaged.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"However, it makes it a weird noise when I insert or remove disks.. also when it reads disks.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The noise sounds like it pauses from inserting the disk rapidly and the same when reading or removing.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Overall it works great.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"My son likes the PS4, however when he first opened it and loaded the game that came with it, the PS4 would not load the game or work.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Gave him an error message, we did clean the game to see if it helped and it loaded fine.","1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,4,I bought him another game to see if it would work and it did.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Hoping the PS4 doesn't have an issue going forward and that it was just poor service that the new game included with it was dirty right out of the box.,"1,7",C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"My son is 28, has had the PS3 and is very familiar with it and handling of the games so definitely a manufacturer issue.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,This was suppose to be a new console.,3,,,

B01LRLJV28,4,Good,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,love it just wish it came with a different game that I usually played,"2,3",,Feature Request,
B01LRLJV28,4,I really like this but the loss of an optial out its really annoying.,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,I got turtle beach 400 and it requires an optical out.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,other than that it is amazing!!!!!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Worked well for 2 weeks then died.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Amazon replaced it with no hassle .,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I just bought a used ps4 that cost me 190 bucks and it works great so but when it delivered I had to go to Fed ex to pick it up or get sighed and it didn't came with the uncharted box just the ps4 white box but still has everything else,"3,7",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,The best price I found for a PS4.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Came super quick (less then 48 hours) Excited!!!!!!!!!,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This model has no optical audio output.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,In fact it has no audio output other than the HDMI output which means that if you have a dedicated surround sound receiver you will get no audio when gaming.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Won't work and CD keeps on getting stuck after o e month of usage.,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Bought as a Christmas gift and it doesn't work.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Now I have to take the time to send it back and wait for another one.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Hopefully the new one will work and won't have problems down the road,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,I opened it up and uncharted was already opened and the game wasn't inside,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The PS4 is a great product except for the fact that power failures are catastrophic for the unit.,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It is made for such an stable energy supply that it can handle a few failures.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Who doesn't experience power shortage due to blown breakers, connectors failure or a simply blunder like turning the energy off by accident.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Console freezes or does not work well when power returns.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B01LRLJV28,3,"I received this and have only been playing grand theft auto 5 on it for a good 20-30 hours however I am now starting to experiencing it freezing and unfreezing at random times, for example while playing the game it will freeze for about 2-3 seconds and then comes out of it and back to normal and be playing, I could play an hour before it happens again or 3 minutes and it will happen again it's very Random","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,3,I was looking in my account and apparently you doubble charged the console on the 25th and 28th,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Great product, great price.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I did purchase it during Prime Days.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,It came with lots of extras.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,On the first day of playing after 1 hour.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,When I came back to turn it on the controller wasn't syncing.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,After trying different methods I just unplugged the ps4 and now it won't even turn back on.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Returned it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Very bad experience.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,I used for only one month and now the device is not working.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Sorry to mention that device is not working now.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It is what it is .,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Seems to be well put together.The price was very reasonable.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Do not buy this.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,It stopped working a little less then a month of purchasing.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,My son took very good care of it.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Return window closed.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I got the ps4 to play they vr.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I’ve always been a Xbox fan but it’s so worth switching over for the VR.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I loved the next day shipping I got.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's good,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Delivered quickly.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I hate the fact that Playstation got rid of an audio out for the slim version, as it is almost a deal breaker for me.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I wish I had done more research prior to buying this bundle.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Great value on a refurbished console.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Has worked perfectly without an issue.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Package came a day early which is a plus.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,It's a great console.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"But trying to get the internet set up took me 5 DAYS just to do because of all the error I kept getting, and it wasn't from my end cause every wifi available product I had, had worked So while it was a chore and really frustrating trying to get the internet on (kept searching and trying all the solutions I could find in forums) but as soon as I got the internet to work the console is great overall.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,graphics are ok.,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I read with the new update, the ps4 was backwards compatible (plays games from ps3) but it wasn't.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,2,The games graphics are ok but definitely not worth $400.,2,,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,2,I'll pass.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Game is nice is design but i''ll stick to xbox 1.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,5,This was on sale for $212 and I'm so glad I grabbed it.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,5,You don't get as many 'good' free games like Xbox but PS4 has a lot of great sales to get the games you want.,5,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The controller won't take a charge and appearently this is a widely reported issue.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The review hasn't anything bad to do with Amazon.. but if you have been with Xbox that's where I'd stay..,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The games do have some good graphics but unlike the Playstation 3 u need a card just like the Xbox and Xbox 360 and 1.. more games for Xbox better made and overall not worth the money.,"1,5",P,,
B01LRLJV28,2,The extras are expensive and after I bought it it's gone down 50 dollars within a few days.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,There is also rumors they are doing away with this system and making an upgrade.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,It will be hard to expand a collection if finances are not for disposal so easily in the time before they cut off making new and selling games and accessories ..,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This item would have been perfect but it almost ruined Christmas Day for my son and because this was the only gift he was asking for and when we open it the item was missing the AC power cord so he could not play it on Christmas without the cord.,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Luckily after calling around on Christmas Day because everything was closed and I couldn't go buy one I found a friend who had one on his old PlayStation that we can use until the stores open up for us to go buy one.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This was so annoying....,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,The ps4 says overheating then shuts off.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Why is it doing this I can't even play it,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"IF YOU HAVE A HIGH END GAMING HEADSET, GO WITH THE ORIGINAL PS4 OR THE PRO.",5,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Sony saw fit to remove the digital optical port from the slim version, so unless you have a playstation brand wireless headset, you are gonna be stuck with your tv speakers.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,2,Thank you Sony for making us pay extra to retain the same features.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,3,My box came all beat up.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"Haven't opened it yet as it is a gift for someone, but that's ridiculous.",7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,We will see if it works correctly.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"for some reason mine came with the casing covering the harddisk ajar and literally dropped off after i tried to fixed it back currently it is still not entirely fixed back as one of the catch refuse to get inside one of the holes also i had 2 games - Dance 2016 and Unchartered 4, Both DVDs failed on me while i was playing it for the first time.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,After that there were no failures.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,no games cd encluded..,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,It arrived at my house broken it will not read any discs,"1,7",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Unlike the regular PS4 the Slim is really noisy.,"1,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"The Slim is my kids system and they asked me if it was OK/broke because of the noise, my answer is I don't know if it is normal or a bad unit.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I see lots of debates on it being the fans running when hot but that is not it, at least in my case, it's the BlueRay drive spinning at max speed which is noisy itself but it also vibrates the whole console causing even more noise.","1,4",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I use my regular PS 4 to watch BlueRay movies but if the Slim makes all that noise on a movie it wouldn't be usable but I haven't tried that yet as the Slim is my kids system.,"1,4,5",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,While the PS4 Slim seems like a good game console I can't give  it better then 3 stars as the noise it makes is just silly and ruins the experience .,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,System runs good but only complaint is that my PS4 box is very beat up ...,"2,3",,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,4,Console: 5/5 stars.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,I haven't found anything to complain about with regards to the console.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Controller: 3/5 stars.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"I absolutely hate the thumb sticks on these controllers, especially the left one.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"First off, they have very limited grip - my thumb was constantly slipping off before I bought third party grips to put on them.","1,4",C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Secondly, for me, they are very fatiguing to my thumbs.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"In games (all of them) where you need to push the left thumb stick forward for movement, it just feels like such a chore to hold the stick down.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Overall: 4/5 stars,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Slim and light weight!,1,P,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Gorgeous console.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Not much storage, but a great buy if you're a casual gamer or having a LAN party ;)","1,3",P,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Bought brand new..,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Tried to use it and surprise !surprise!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Controller doesn't work!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Had to buy a new one!,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Good product unless you get banned by PlayStation then pretty much useless.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Continuous problem with having no sound.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Very disappointed should have checked Walmart first they had better pricing but otherwise the product is good just could have saved a little money is all,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,"I like my new PS4, but it's really over priced, this thing costs too much money to run .... you need another controller, you have to pay for every single option, games are expensive, PS Plus needs money every month or 3 months or whatever way you want .",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,PS Now isn't free ... so why this thing costs over $269 by the time i made the purchase ?,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Would have gave it 5 stars but does not play CDs WTF,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,So this PlayStation doesn't work well.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,It crashes constantly unless I turn off system music (weird right?,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,1,figured out because I would hear constant popping instead of the system music).,"1,4",C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,And the logo on the ps4 looks like it was heavily rubbed?,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"As if someone took an eraser and touched it constantly, and considering this PlayStation is supposed to be brand new it shouldn't look like that.",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,"It's a Christmas gift for my sister so I can't just exchange it without inconveniencing her, so I'm very unhappy with this purchase.","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Uncharted need a little more to the single player short, but worth a try.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"The PS4 itself is great, light, east to set up, but the hard drive needs to be bigger.",1,"P,R",,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Should have been an amazing device -- great specs, great games, solid utility.","1,2,3",P,Information Giving,
B01LRLJV28,2,"However, it was only after purchasing several titles and getting the entire system set up that we discovered that there is one detail quietly inserted in the game descriptions that is not at all obvious to first-timers... 'requires PS+' (i.e., a monthly subscription).","3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"I'm sure experienced console gamers out there know to look out for this sort of thing, but for a guy that has spent 20+ years gaming on PCs, it was not even on my radar that you could buy a game and have it *completely* unplayable unless you shell out $5-$10/month to Sony for the rest of the life of the console.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,I pay for my own internet access and PC servers exist out there -- there is no way Sony needs this money for me to play Overwatch.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,2,They just have the leverage to force people and that's pretty slimy.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"Now I'm out the cost of my game, but there's no way I'll pay $60/year additionally just play what I've already paid for.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"At the very least, they should put a pop-up warning at purchase...  'In order to play this game you will be required to subscribe to PS+.'",2,,Feature Request,
B01LRLJV28,2,"However, it seems they don't mind holding customers hostage.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,"For the people out there that will no doubt defend Sony, yes they have the right to do whatever they want with their product.",8,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,This is about making it very clear to people (especially new ones who I think have a reasonable expectation of being able to play a purchased game without a recurring subscription) that Sony chooses to force customers to pay above and beyond BEFORE somebody has a game purchased and is flat out of luck.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It's a PlayStation 4.,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,But the one I received is not 500GB.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,It only has 407GB.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3,I get that sometimes the space can vary but a almost a whole 100gigs???,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,That's a bit steep.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2,No AC power cord came with the order...now have to go buy that separately...nice job!,"1,3",P,,
B01LRLJV28,2,!,8,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Two weeks of use and the game controller had to be replaced.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Seems to be a common problem.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"it was ok, the only downside was that the price was drop a week later so i felt like i lost.",3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,but it is awesome and it is working fine.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"Great system, the graphics are amazing and it's pretty quiet.","1,3",P,,
B01LRLJV28,4,Only problem I had is that the HDMI cord was super flimsy and broke upon the first attempt to remove it from my tv.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Console never operated for longer than 15 mins.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Got this so called blue light of death after it crashed which required unplugging the console from the wall just to get it to restart up only to crash after another 15 mins.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Very unsatisfied.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Never even got to fully set up my PS account before it would crash again.,"3,4",,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Get your s*** together Sony.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,Controller is already messing up within a month of owning it.,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,4,"nice unit, wish you didn't have to wait so long to let updates download off the servers...way too slow","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Traded in Xbox Pneand bought a new PS4, mainly for MLB the show.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,"Amazing graphics on the PS4, and I love the slim because it saves energy and doesn’t heat up as much.","1,3",P,,

B01LRLJV28,3,Fast shipping.,7,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,But the ps4 is very noisy sometimes,1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,5,I saw the commercial at Christmas time where the grandchildren hated going to grandma's house because of the outdated technology.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,So I bought a PS4 and my grandchildren couldn't wait to have overnights at my house over the holidays.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,5,Hope the PS4 continues to draw them!,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3,The ps4 works perfectly fine but the controller doesn't work fine trying to type with it is like playing a game of luck to hit the precise letter or number or you have to do it all over agin,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,1,Please let me know how to get in touch with seller.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,1,I need to see if there is a warranty on this - It is less than 4 months old and the controller doesn't work right - the input for the mic is not working properly.,1,C,,

B01LRLJV28,2,It must have been meant for me not to own a PS4 because when I happened to go to return Infamous and Little Big Planet it also happened to be this one employees last day there and her experience with that company wasn't as pleasant as she hoped so she kindly gave me a full refund....even though she wasn't supposed to.,4,,,
