B01DFKC2SO,3,We have had some issues with the Nest and the Echo Dot not working together when it is supposed to and there are times when it just doesn't recognize commands even though we've don't tons of voice training with the device.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I also find it mildly annoying that you can't just ask a question like,  'Alexa, what sound does a whale make?'",2,,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,4,It's fun though.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Paired easily enough with the Alexa app on my phone and my Bose Soundlink II bluetooth speaker.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Not as comprehensive in it's answers as my Google Home, but it's much easier to ask Alexa to tell Harmony to turn on an activity than it is to say 'Hey Google, tell Harmony to turn on...' in exactly the right inflection to match my initial voice pairing.","2,4,5",,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,4,Or at least my z-wave/zigbee networked house.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,I didn't see the value in it and wasn't too impressed with its audio and picking up voice (had to repeat commands or questions).,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I decided to get the dot since it's cheaper.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The good: its smaller and can use USB power.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Audio is loud enough and can plug into your home audio system, car, Bluetooth speakers.",1,P,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,The 1st one died in 3 months and I did not buy the insurance on it.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I contacted Amazon and they said they'd send me another echo for $49 which I totally balked at.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I told them it didn't make sense for me to spend $49 for another one when the first one didn't even last three months!,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,After much discussion an Amazon customer service supervisor agreed to send me a replacement at no charge.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Kudos to Amazon for standing up for what's right.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I was offered the echo debut price of 99 a long time ago and held out until the 2017 prime day deal on the dot.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The dots speaker is great, I was very surprised actually.",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"For a single room, listening to podcasts, or music even, it beats the portable bluetooth speaker I had been using.",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I would say that if you are thinking you are going to need a bigger speaker, get the dot first before you purchase a speaker to see if the dot alone meets your needs.",1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I will be pairing it with a new speaker because I'd already scored another awesome prime deal, but for other rooms in the future where I would like additional dots, I don't think it's necessary.","1,6",C,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"It drops from the wi-fi a lot,,,, some things such as finding stores is pretty cool and playing music .......... it's ok - nothing super exciting but can be helpful.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I absolutely loved my Echo dot until I realized there is ZERO security and anyone within range can connect their phone to your device via Bluetooth.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I live in the city and countless people are always within range of my device.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"It is pretty neat, but could use a lot of work.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It only uses Bing to search, I ask for it to play a song, it's not in my music library, so it won't play, when normally I can Google or you tube and have it play.","2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I ask for the weather in my town, but since my internet provider is based out of a town an hour north, it gives me the weather for that town, and I can't set a default for my actual town that I want the weather for.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,That's just a few minor annoyances I have noticed so far.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,Right now we use it for voice activated music and to power some smart devices — so not much.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,I was expecting some type of app or program for the PC to enhance the echo and i got a poorly designed web page based app that is hard to navigate and offers limited interaction with the echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,You can not even make the most out of Amazon music unlimited because the music program does not interact with the Echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,You would think a forward thinking company like Amazon would have the foresight to cover all of its customers options equally.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Amazon if you read this not everyone in the world lives their life dictated by an expensive cell phone that is basically a under powered small computer.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Echo is a home entertainment device not a portable speaker that should require a cell phone.,"1,2",O,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,5,My gripes with the system are that I seem to have to switch back and forth between the mobile Alexa app on my FIre and my PC based one account management options depending on what I want to manage or setup--this is likely a user issue and not a system issue.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,4,I would buy this again.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,"Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.","1,4",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Other than that failure, I've loved having it!",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"The only thing that might annoy someone is that if you say anything with the word 'Alexa' in it, then it responds.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Trying to tell someone about it while on the phone necessitated leaving the room when 'she' took off talking!,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It was quite funny & in time I'm sure we'll remember to not do that & how to use it more effectively.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I like the random info it gives & while we intended to use it mainly as a clock/radio, we regularly ask for a joke, put together shopping lists, to-do lists & set timers.",2,,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"But in the meantime, we're having a blast with 'Alexa'!",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,was not very good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Had trouble to get it to work and it still is not very good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,If I had to rate in on a scale of 1 to 9 and 9+ being to best  I would give it a 3.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,You know all of the other things you can do with the Dot/Echo so I won't run them all down.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I was surprised that with the Dot, you still have a small speaker it is sufficient to hear Alexa's responses to your queries.",1,C,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"I've found that using it for anything else is more work than it's worth, at least for me.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's about 90% reliable so I have reasonable confidence that it'll do what I want.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Anthropomorphizing machines to make them more personal is an annoying trend.,3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"Most of the time, it does what it's suppose to without overdoing the embellishments of simulated conversation.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I have an Echo dot positioned near my computer where I watch videos and listen to music so there are a lot of false triggers.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Most of the time it just turns on and beeps off but sometimes it talks back saying it doesn't understand.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I wish it would just turn off instead of saying something.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's great for what it is.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,A cheap entry level solution into a 'home assistant' or whatever you want to call it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My recommendation is to hook it up to another speaker so the sound quality is better, as it is a truly terrible speaker that's built in - I'm sure as a reason to buy their more expensive models.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Seems to work good.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My only real complaint is that it has a few false positives, sometimes responding to the TV if audio says anything remotely close to 'alexa'.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Granted you can change the trigger word to something else, but it's just worth noting.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Definitely not as flexible as Google home in terms of responding.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Quit working after 3 days of use.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"If you're thinking about whether getting this or Google home, I suggest you getting the later.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Google home has much better potential then Alexa, and doesn't look cheap","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"This is overall a good, quality product.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We use it almost exclusively for alarms and playing music off of spotify playlists.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"If you have the volume cranked, she may have trouble hearing, but this is typically not an issue.","1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Pros: Great alarm clock/timer Plays spotify playlists easy for the kids to use Shopping list is nice Cons: Skills are not quite smart enough yet Siri has more answers for things Ecobee control is not intuitive (as are most specialized skills) I would definitely buy this again, and I am thinking about getting more for the house.","2,4",,Information Giving,Define both pros and cons
B01DFKC2SO,4,The convenience factor is way up there and it looks great.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Used it often when first set up for 'specifically requested music.',"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Of late, haven't used it as much because of switching to DirecTV and listening to its music channels.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Granddaughter loves the Echo Dot for her favorite music and to answer her questions.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Probably would use it much more if it was connect to other devices and systems in the house.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But if you are concerned with 'privacy' you may not want a device in your home that listens to audio in the room and tracks what is being said.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Funny how many of those with 'privacy' concerns post their entire life on Facebook for the world to see.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Great price for a cool gadget.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Has limitations though.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Can't answer detailed questions but knows the basics.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Also, it's annoying when Alexa responds even when it hears it's name from the tv or on a youtube video you may be watching.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Plus it will only play songs you've purchased or have uploaded into your library.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,At $40 though you should have one on every level of your home.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's a great alarm clock and reminder.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Worth it!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Sounds like a tin can, terrible compared to the Echo, I regret purchasing it.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Just placed an order for another Echo to replace the DOT.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The DOT will probably be a gift to someone I do not like very much.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Sound is not great for music, perhaps the Echo itself is better.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You also cannot sync and voice command with your iTunes library on your phone, only Amazon Music, Pandora, SIRUS XM, and a few others.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It got on a Prime Day deal, so i guess the $35 was worth it, but i wouldn't have been happy if i paid more for it.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I'll rate again at a later date as i've only used a few weeks and haven't ordered from it yet, only asked weather, and controlled music.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I purchased this in July (2017).,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It is now September and my Echo is now malfunctioning.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I can give it a command to play my music, but after that I cannot give other commands and I am told by the device to try later.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Within 20 minutes, it stops playing my downloaded music.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Any attempts to rectify the problem is met with a swirling red light and advises me to try later.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I have tried to reset it with negative results.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Sound is ridiculously low but Alexa is very smart,"1,2",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Here's the basics.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use.,1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Not for every day use.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"We don't shop that often, so the usefulness of this device is limited to a voice activated radio, a trivia game, a hard of hearing person who you have to repeat your question to just for the answer to be incorrect.","2,4,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"The dot was a deal, but I would wait until Amazon has better programming for Alexa, or buy a Google home.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Horrible and useless after initial novelty wears off  Has not acquired any new funtions or learned from use.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Another great product from Amazon.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The only downer is the speaker doesn't pick up from more than a few feet away but I didn't buy it for a large room so it's perfect for what I wanted it for.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Update:  I'd really love it if Amazon would allow multiple devices to stream their music, because this can't happen I will not buy another Dot or even an echo.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Which is too bad because I had plans on buying one for each of our kids in their rooms since they love to listen to Amazon music.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I love my echo dot - it's a great price point, inexpensive enough that I don't feel guilty buying it.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I use it the most for time, timers, stopwatch, weather, shopping list, music and to find my phone.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bad move Amazon.,7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If (when) google voice provides an entry price point for their Google Home line, the only advantage Alexa will have is ordering off Amazon.","3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,OK ~ I give up!!!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,can not get it to work.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,we have the full-size echo and hooked it up just fine and enjoy it.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"this dot, however -- cannot get it connected.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,i'm not the most tech savvy... therefore enlisted my brother-in-law AND son on different occasions... and neither could get it connected.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,any suggestions will be appreciated.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"otherwise, going to return.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,thanks ~,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I ordered this in January and have enjoyed listening to news each morning.,"2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"After 4 months, it started re-starting randomly during play.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Now, at less than five months, it won't respond.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I have tried unplugging it, then re-plugging it back in.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It starts up, says Hello.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"When I start a request, the blue light comes on, but turns off after about 1 second, before I can complete my request.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I am disappointed that it started with problems at 4 months, and now doesn't work at all.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I bought the Dot thinking I'd be able to play music from the Dot through my Denon receiver with Bluetooth.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I erroneously assumed this would pair with the Bluetooth receiver, as my research showed that both have the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and should, therefore, have been compatible.","1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"However, the Dot would not pair with the receiver.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The guy I talked with in tech support confirmed that they would not pair, and said Amazon should change the description to reflect that a device may support the A2DP profile but still not pair.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"In order to pair my phone with my receiver, I had to enter a pass code into my phone.","2,4",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The Dot does not have the capability to do that.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bottom line is that the Dot doesn't pair with any of my devices.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I had to do a work around by plugging a stereo mini plug into the headphone jack on the Dot with split RCA plugs on the other end into the audio in jacks on the back of the receiver.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Not exactly ideal, as the Dot has to remain near the receiver.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,My Amazon Echo Dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Gets worse the more it is used.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Even after a hard reset, it works terribly.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Buy Google Home instead.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Grabbed this li'l thing during a sale.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Been wanting one for the bedroom so I wouldn't have to continually haul Alexa to and from the living room whenever I wanted to chill with her.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's certainly convenient in that respect.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Only two things that kinda bum me out about Dot are: a) the sound quality isn't even close to as nice as her big sister, which I suppose is to be expected from a smaller unit, and sounds akin to the quality of my iPhone's built-in speaker.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,b) I can't have both Echo and Echo Dot streaming the same music/media simultaneously.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It's gotta be one or the other.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Was really hoping this would work, so that there'd be a seamless stream of music from one room to the next as you walk around the house.","2,6",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Ah well.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Other than those things, we still really dig her.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,She now sits on the nightstand and has since replaced our iPhone alarm clocks to wake us with a better variety of alarms (the Top Gear guys wake up call is my personal fave).,"2,3,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Bought 4 of these speaker isn't loud at all..,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I thought...what could go wrong with a 90 day warranty.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,My unit started to make a buzzing noise when connected to external speakers.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Unit was 7 months old.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Get the warranty extension.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Customer support spend an hour trying to help me until giving up.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Was angry enough with my stupidity for having a 90 day warranty - but the alternatives are not quite there yet.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Could not connect to my wifi waiting for my daughter to help,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Hard to set up: it took more than an hour because the app couldn't coordinate the bluetooth or the wifi, kept crashing or hanging.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After restarting the echo, phone and app multiple times, a google search showed that sometimes some part of android needs to be updated for the Alexa app to work.","2,3,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I didn't have that problem but it still took another 45 minutes to set up.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The alexa app is the worst.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The echo is ok as speakers go, though the bluetooth is frustrating and iffy at best (it once took me an hour to connect my laptop to my Echo because neither the app or the echo could 'find' the computer's bluetooth).",1,"C,P",,
B01DFKC2SO,3,It's also super annoying (and not totally clearly stated) that it's not possible to link Echos (or dots) together.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Why does all of the Amazon stuff stink?,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Fussy, hard to use, finicky.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The gear from the big G just works and is totally drama free.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Quite straightforward - gives me news and music when I ask.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Sometimes it overhears conversations not intended for her ears.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"For example we were talking about dialling 911 in an adjoining room, and Alexa, taking this as an order, started to do so without being asked!!","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,There should be a cross check by Alexa saying 'Do you really want me to dial 911?'.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,That would only add a couple of seconds to the response time.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Matthew,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"lots of bugs, glitches and problems that the company cant seem to keep up with.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"lots of developers experimenting on the skill market without trying the skills, effectiveness first.","2,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I got this and the Google Home when they just came out.,"4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I keep the Echo at my parent's house and the Home at my apartment, and use both with smart plugs, smart lighting, Logitech Harmony, Nest, Bose Soundtouch, etc.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After a few months, I can say with certainty I absolutely prefer the Google Home, and think the extra money spent is worth it.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"PROS: - LOTS of skills, including the TP Link smart devices, which work well - Asks for voice feedback and has voice training to ensure it understands you - Can work with an awesome speaker, like Bose or Sonos -AllRecipes integration, though should work better CONS: - Voice recognition isn't there yet - everyone in my family gets mad at Alexa.","1,2",P,Information Giving,and Human Usability
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You  say 'Turn lights on'  and it starts playing Sara Bareilles..... -You have to ask very specific phrases, whereas if you tweak the phrasing in Google Home, it still knows what you're talking about - A lot of the awesome, obscure skills, but even without account integration, you need to enable them and remember their names.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Alexa, ask WineBuddy to''.",8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"You need to remember all the specific commands for them to work All in all, for $50 it's good - but I'd recommend waiting for it to improve or trying another device.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it!",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"We also like the 'skills', especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the 'tight pants' song lyrics which is a family favorite.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Overall I am happy with it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Cannot train it to understand my wife's accent.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"She' takes only a little time to get used to, but the set-up did not go well the first time I tried it.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The instructions need to be more definitive on what to do and when.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"That said, the sound quality is absolutely incredible given the very small size (on a solid surface).",1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The response is very accurate although I did try to search for a composer who shares a name with a country and western singer so when I said, 'play all by…' I got the wrong person until I specified '…by composer …' I very much like the change of color in the top light ring when she is asked for something.","1,2,4,6",O,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,5,My kids love it to check homework (Alexa is GREAT at math!,"2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"), and play games such as 20 questions.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It is small and non-intrusive with your home decor.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"This purchase is for a Christmas gift - my father quizzes Alexa whenever he is at my house, so this is for him.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I highly recommend Alexa- specifically this small Echo Dot - and a small bluetooth speaker to use it with.,"1,3,5",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"While I have two and an Echo, I would love to exchange them for the Google variant.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Alexa is not good, it is not improving as I'd expected and other than consuming Pandora, TuneIn, and Amazon Prime music I use it to turn on WeMo switches, but that's it, don't expect anything else.","2,5,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,3,UPDATE 2: Sound and operation is better face down.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Bought this product and was not the easiest to set up.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I used it for a week and then tried taking it to a new location and it would never turn all the way on (always acted like it was still 'booting up') so I thought if I took it back to where I originally had it that I would work..,"2,4,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I was wrong.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"However, this product was very useful while it worked.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I'm happy enough with the product, but Amazon lost two stars because they made too many assumptions.","3,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I had purchased this as a gift using Amazon Prime, but it didn't even ship for two days.","4,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Days after giving it to the recipient (already late), I noticed in my Alexa app that the new Echo Dot had automaticallt been registered to my account, but it wasn't intended to be mine!.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"After all, it's a voice controlled device so the app isn't needed unless you're making changes like adding a Wemo.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I might not have noticed this for months!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I hope this wasn't the cause for problems he had setting up his Echo.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,He asked me for help setting it up a full month after I have it to him.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Wonderful little device (alexa, ask for a fart)  This device is full of endless fun and resources.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Out of the box it works wonderfully but as you gradually add in or enable various skills you will find this device to be extremely handy.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy) My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Example: Alexa, whats on my calendar tomorrow?","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Alexa: You have an appointment with the eye doctor at (long pause) 30 pm.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,5,This is my 2nd Echo Dot as my 1st one freaked but I had the warranty so it could be replaced.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I haven't had any issues with this one other than it did come on by itself one night and said it couldn't find the answer to the question I had asked.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The house was quiet and I hadn't said anything so that was a tad freaky.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,It made me jump a bit and say a word that is similar to poop when it started talking!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The other thing is there are numerous commercials advertising Alexa now days and if the TV happens to be up loud enough my Echo will come on upon hearing the Alexa name and then it is confused about the question it was asked.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If I can, I quickly place a rag, small pillow or blanket on top of it or try and hit the TV mute button when those commercials start to keep that from happening.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,There are so many different things that can be asked of the Echo and a ton of music to choose from for it to play as well.,2,,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,1,I can't use it in Brazil.,"3,4",,,

B01DFKC2SO,1,Did not like this item....have replaced it with google which I have not put into operation yet.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Most of the questions that I asked Echo were responded to with 'I do not know the answer to that question'.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I would then ask google on my phone and I would get the answer.,"2,4,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It did work properly turning off my lights and giving time and weather....,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bought this for my teen-aged daughter.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"She was very excited, until she found out that she needs to purchase monthly services for everything she'd like to do with the device.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I think Amazon needs to be very clear up front that things like music must be purchased and that other features require special set-up which also cost money.,"3,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Also, after I purchased this Dot through Amazon, I saw it on sale at several stores locally for $10 cheaper.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Not happy.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Love my echo bought the dot for my bedroom.,"3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Now I wish I had just gotten another echo for the bedroom.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The dot does not hear me when I'm standing right over it.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Infuriating to get it to work on a basic command.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,My echo works great.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,This dot is just garbage.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Too late to return it.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Guess I'll wait for the regular echo to go on sale and replace it with something that works.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I shouldn't have to yell a wake word at something I'm standing right over.,"2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Disappointing.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Very disappointed in all  three that I've had.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,They lose connection to the internet all the time.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Very very frustrating.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I have excellent internet reception and I even put in an extender to help out and they still lose reception all the time.,"1,4",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,My last one just straight up stopped working and the day it did was the exact day that I couldn't return it anymore.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,That sucked,"4,8",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I bought this for my kitchen because I was curious about whether Alexa is useful or not.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,What a great buy!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"My wife and I had never used Amazon music before, but now we listen to it all the time.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The voice recognition works perfectly, even my 5 year old has no problem using it.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"My wife loves how she can select music, start/stop or change volume with voice commands while she is holding our baby daughter, since she would have no free hand to do it in the phone.","2,4,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Also, Amazon has great lullaby stations!",7,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Amazon's Dot comes up short when we're talking about general facts.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Alexa doesn't search the web for relative information as compared to Siri.,"2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I can ask the identical questions to Siri or Alexa only to have Alexa answer 'Sorry I don't know that answer' or 'Sorry I don't understand the question'.,"2,5,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,About the only thing she does well is play and control music selections.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I still have been unable to setup the Echo Dot.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The Iphone App still shows setup page not complete.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"From what I have been able to determine, the 'Home' controls, i.e.",4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,1,"Dot not very useful, will go in a drawer of unused items.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Perhaps we are asking difficult questions that Alexa cannot answer.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But we don't get much out of our questioning.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I guess it just has to be one subject and one verb in the question.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Then last night, when we were in bed at 11:30 pm, Alexa started playing music at a high volume level.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We had to turn off the microphone and unplug it.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The free ebook on the Echo Dot didn't give much explanation on how to talk to Alexa.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"But it's still a fun little item for asking the weather, though it doesn't understand the pronunciation of our city and I have to ask a couple of times.","2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"We were hoping to use it like the Etymological Dictionary, finding out the origins of words and things.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,We'll keep trying.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It is a unique device and I'm sure it will only get getter in time.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Less then 6 months after I got it its not working right it's slow and lagging can't connect to the Internet now I can't return it,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Love this - it's got a lot to learn but it's certainly helpful around the house.,"3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I can ask 'what's the traffic' and she'll tell me how long it's going to take to get to work (pretty close in terms of timing); 'add ____ to the shopping list' - I never forget the list on the counter since it shows up on the app; 'play _____' radio station, Pandora channel, news flash - super helpful.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The speaker is decent, not great, so I just connected it to a Bluetooth speaker and it's perfect.",1,P,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,Decided that it worked so well that it needed and stylish makeover.,"1,3",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,So I secured it on an old radio box and the wooden box make the speakers so much more vibrant and the box I have lets me have all the buttons.,"4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Essentially this is an Alexa listening unit rather than a playback for streaming music.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Even with the ability to pair to a BT speaker, this is not a good alternative to an Echo...","1,3",P,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,A great concept but still very much a work in progress.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The main problem is that it is unreliable as it is plagued by underwhelming voice recognition.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Many times thinks that it is summoned even though there were no words remotely close to its name.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It seems to have gotten worse with time (perhaps after activations increased and the Amazon service is too slow to cope).,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Price is good and the potential is there but the G units are way more accurate.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Well, it does connect to the internet, it does respond to voice control, and it does what it says it's supposed to do.","1,2",P,Information Giving,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"Connectivity is decent, though sometimes playback gets cut off sometimes.",1,"P,C",,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I think that may have more to do with my home bandwidth or something rather than the device functionality.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"The Echo Dot is great for smaller rooms like offices, bathrooms or bedrooms.","3,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,You still get all the functionality of Alexa without having a large echo or tap unit as an eye sore in the room.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,You do lose volume with the smaller Dot but in a smaller space it doesn't really make a difference.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,If you buy this make sure to take advantage of the Alaxa newsletter so you get all of the new (they add stuff every week) functionality and apps out of it.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Also take a look at the app wiki so you can activate all the stuff you will actually use.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,This is the second Echo Dot I've purchased after initially getting one to control my entertainment devices in my den.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I've since added some wifi outlets to control lighting and I have a wifi thermostat, so all of them can be controlled from either Alexa (upstairs or downstairs) by whichever one can hear me better.","4,6",,,

B01DFKC2SO,4,"The iHome device I paired it with shuts off after a certain amount of time, so that does me no good overnight.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,(not an issue of the echo) Outside of the sound it works great.,1,P,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,I had to figure out why the rings were flashing overnight (it drove me nuts at first)...it means you have a notification.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,2,The speaker is terrible.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Awful.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I can pair it to bluetooth speakers, but then again, I could just pair my phone to the speakers.",1,C,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,Prime music used to be included in your membership.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I don't understand why it's not portable.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"I would love to be able to move it from one room to the other to use it as a morning alarm, but it has to stay plugged in in the living room to be of any use to me at all.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It definitely does not do enough to be worth the $50 price tag, particularly when it's stationary and has poor sound quality.","1,3",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If you're just going to use the Dot for podcasts, internet radio, news briefings, weather, home controls, etc., the included speaker in this little unit is fine.","1,2,6",P,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"If you listen to a lot of music, the Dot is really intended to use through an external speaker or audio system, via either a male-male headphone cable (not included) or Bluetooth.","5,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,One great use for these is to turn an old clock radio that has an audio-in jack into a voice enabled internet radio and alarm.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I actually think Amazon would do well to release an Echo clock radio, but meanwhile retrofitting one with a Dot also works.",8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I converted two Logitech internet radios this way, and a standard stereo Sony clock radio.",5,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,I use them ALL THE TIME.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"When I discovered all the practical uses for the Echo, I couldn't wait to buy some Dots so I can have Alexa all over the house.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Now I don't have to get up and go to the main Echo to ask or tell Alexa something.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I use these for everything from making lists, setting alarms and timers, asking about the forecast for weather and traffic, playing music, controlling my smart home devices, and much more.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The Dot is a particularly good value for the money; the speakers are a bit tinny sounding but that is overcome if you add an external speaker for better sound quality.,"1,3",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I wholeheartedly recommend the Dot if you just want to try out all the things Alexa can do to help make your life a bit easier.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I have the full sized Echo and love it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Got one of these for the bedroom to play kids music during bath+dress time.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,It mostly just wants to play games.,6,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,"The bad news is all of the audio comes out of either the Dot speaker OR the AUX out, never both.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,There's no way to have music sent through the AUX jack while Alexa responses like weather and calendar updates come out of the Dot speakers.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,This means you either have to have your stereo on all the time or plug in the Dot for music and then unplug it for general everyday use.,"1,6",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"This isn't a dealbreaker, but it's a pretty aggravating oversight.",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,2,"Half the time I ask Alexa to play certain music the response is ' I'm having trouble hearing you', whereupon I unplug and replug device and all of a sudden she can hear me.",3,,,

B01DFKC2SO,3,We had not informed anybody that we had an Echo at that time.,4,,,

B01DFKC2SO,5,"I use it mainly to control the lights in my house, but I know she can do so much more.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I have some problems making it interface w/my Ecobee 3, it most often says it can't perform that function even though it is connected and set up properly, but considering it works fine everywhere else, I'm okay w/that.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Small, non descript, most people don't even notice it even thought it sits right in front of my TV.",1,O,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Very responsive, hears me 95% of the time (and sometimes picks up random things from the TV), even from the other room, and I can talk in a normal voice, not yell (XBOX you need to step up your game, you hardly ever hear me even when I scream at you!)",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Wish it was more interactive with other smart home products (like my receiver so I could change the volume on my sound system), and the shopping list worked better w/OneNote.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"Still needs improvement, but I can't imagine going back to life w/out Alexa.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,When we 1st got the dot a few months ago I loved it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Now, I can't keep the dot paired with my Onkyo tx-nr626 speakers, after a few hours off, we have to manually pair them again.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,It is becoming a pain.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,We use this mainly for listening to music.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,If we could fix this we would be happy campers again.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Device I bought three months ago has given up, it's restarting itself again and again, when I do search it restarts, return policy is of very short duration.","2,3,7",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Not a fan.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"It was sporadic at best, glitched many times, and wasn't very adaptive at realizing what I wanted to say.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Plus, there's not really much out there that I'd need this for anyways.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Sure, it's great for setting alarms and telling it to play music on your bluetooth speakers, but these are all things that can be done with your phone and this only provides a TINY convenience factor...when it works.",5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"When it doesn't work, it's frustrating to no end.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"As this product is now, I'd rather be guaranteed my actions work by using a phone and doing things 'the old way'.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Hard to set up.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I have a larger Alexa and the echo dot was for the office.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It has trouble syncing with wifi in multiple places.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I purchased it to ask it questions.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"If I see some one on tv or see some reference to some place or some historical event, I like the idea of being to use it as a verbal search engine.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I don't have any interest in ordering things verbally or controlling appliances verbally.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Recently I have been seeing adds on tv for the Google Home.,"4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I looked it up and the reviews state it is much better as a verbal search engine than Echo Dot.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I will purchase one of those.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The Echo Dot doesn't seem to be able to give detailed answers on any of my questions and often says it cannot answer the question.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"According to the reviews, the Google Home is much more capable as an information search engine.","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"Wasn't given 2nd generation, only the black dot.","5,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Sometimes can't fill the TV request.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Fun to interact with if you ask the right questions.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It is now several days later and I just looked at Alexa and guess what?,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Her sides are white.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"I wasn't paying attention to her sides, just the top.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,We did get the 2nd generation and enjoy playing with her.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Bought this to use where my full Echo was having issues connecting to speakers.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"From that perspective, it works well.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"My only complaint, and while it may be 'minor' to some, it is a major inconvenience for the application this was purchase for.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The Dot was working with the remote, but for some reason, it now no longer does.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Going through the configuration app indicates the dot and remote are connected, but it just turns on / off when trying to speak a command.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,"Well, I am attempting to use the echo Dot with my Harmony Elite and hub.","4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The integration between these apps is nowhere near functional.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The Alexa app attempts to assign features and control that does not correspond to the harmony software setup.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,In my case I have multiple equipments in multiple rooms and when Alexa attempts to assign functionality it has no relationship to what room associated with what function associated with what equipment.,"2,4",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I am working with Amazon Echo technical support to try and get the app a little more functional by allowing the user to turn off and remove some of these features that do not apply.,"2,4",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I think the designers are overstepping their capability here.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I will update this review after the process is complete.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Returned,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,This device is the infancy stage of a future (as pictured in many a science fiction story) of useful human / computer interaction.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"The limitations are frustrating, but it will come.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,it will come.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Amusing when a TV add says 'Alexa' (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve .",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,..  Ha ha!,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Voice recognition is very good; and I think that was the tough technological nut to crack.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"The rest (improved AI and interfaces) is easier in my opinion, and will progress rapidly.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Must connect with Bluetooth if you need to use the internal speaker as well as connected speakers.,"1,6",O,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,You need a smart blue tooth receiver that turns on and off with your speakers and automatically reconnects to the dot if you want to avoid always having to connect whether manually or through an Alexa command.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Other than that, brilliant.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Example: most of the time we use Alexa to turn lights on/off.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,No external speakers needed as the internal speaker is sufficient.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"But, when we want music we have to power external speakers and say, Alexa connect Bluetooth if it doesn't issue automatically with the Bluetooth receiver.",6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,When we're done listening we have to shut off the BT receiver or disconnect the Bluetooth.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Not yet perfect system, but pretty darn cool.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The external speaker management is my only gripe.,5,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The sound is not at all like the Echo.,1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,I am still on the fence if I want to return it and just buy another echo because of the sound quality.,"1,5",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"It works for having an 'extension' for your Echo to add things to your list(s), playing your music etc.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"This sucks my phone speaker is better and it has to be plugged in into the wall to beable to to play and the whole reason I got it was because it said I was Bluetooth, I'm sending it back and getting a louder better speaker not from amazon for $20-30 dollars not $49.99 because it was a waist of my money.","3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,I'm gonna send it back tonight and get my money back,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"I bought this thinking it would sound as good as the bigger one I have, I ended up returning it, the sound was awful.",1,C,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Alexa is not as smart as Google Home but she is cheaper and in this size/form it is cheap and easy to use.,"2,3,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The only positive compared to GH is the presence of the audio-Out port.,"1,5",P,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,The companion android app is crap though - very slow to start and not very functional.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"And it can't be used to cast video or audio to chromecast, same way amazon video can't be cast.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Amazon is loosing out by not allowing this functionality, since not many people are buying a proprietary fire stick.","1,2",O,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Have been using it for a while now and here are my observations.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,The response time for any command for Alexa is quite amazing.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I am not going to repeat all the details of how you can shut of the light , play music blah blah.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,But the major drawback I notice is the lack of integration with Google (there is a way to leverage AWS to connect the Dot to google and costs about $5 or so a year based on the requests you make).,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"I still have not figured out a way to stop the alarm, (cancel command clears out all the alarms for other days you set up to), and  there is no way for you to select which sound you want to play by talking to Alexa, (it has to be done through the app).",2,,Inquiry,
B01DFKC2SO,4,These are two of the many issues I felt that Amazon needs to address.,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Overall a satisfied customer waiting for further improvements down the road.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,The Amazon search engine is weak to say the least.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,And Alexa acknowledges commands from male voices better than female.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,We do not use it much but to ask for the current weather conditions.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,We've been using this for 2 scenarios: set-up kitchen timers and read wikipedia for you.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Both works fine, with some understanding issues for complex or long sentences.","2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Unfortunately it cannot search on youtube and play songs from there, that would be ideal when you have crunky kids around the house with little patience for you to pick-up the phone and do a search by typing, and, then let them hold your phone, that is a dangerous thing in its own.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5,"I never do reviews, but this thing is so life-changing, I just had to do one just to give it 5 stars.","3,4",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,I can't believe I didn't get this sooner.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,Would make for an excellent Xmas gift.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5,The microphone captures commands easily and  set-up was a breeze.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"The biggest downside about the dot (and probably all echo devices) is the fact that Alexa uses Bing as its default search engine, which makes for an overabundance of 'hmm, I'm not sure' responses.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"I've yet to test out connectivity to smart home devices, which I've read is one of Alexa's strengths, so my rating may change.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"But so far, the dot doesn't serve much more than as a little novelty and entertainment trinket in my home.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Have bought a couple of these!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,They work really well!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,I like my full size Alexa better but these are great for bedrooms and such!,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Update one died last night!,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,Tried all the trouble shooting steps but it still will not find the Internet.,"1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,2,The other one is still working fine but for some reason this one is basically a paperweight now.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Works about as expected.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Occasionally not hearing what was said - or not hearing it properly, and this is after voice training.","2,6",,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"However, voice control is still in its infancy.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Still not entirely natural language, but closer than many prior voice control technologies were just a few years ago (looking at you in particular, Xbox).","2,5",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Seems to work well so far with other devices (Wemo outlets and a Harmony Elite), with minor hiccups.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Still needs integration with FireTV boxes.,"2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Google already does this with Google Voice Assistant and Chromecast, so Amazon need to catch up.","2,5",,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,One star off for this.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"Still needs work but provides a lot of functionality, once you get past the default marketing concept that underlies the first level of things it can do.",2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"If you enable the skills you can unlock a lot of useful capabilities, from daily bible reading plans, to turning on appliances with added technologies, playing music from your uploaded library or playing iheart or pandora radio stations.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,"There is much still to explore, but answering basic questions is pretty limited and hit or miss as well as reading articles from wikipedia.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,Even with skills you have to be pretty precise how you ask for something like play iheart radio station wtvn radio instead of play iheart radio station wtvn 610 radio which never seems to work.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,or ask bible app for daily reading plan instead of play daily reading plan or ask bible app for daily plan.,6,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,And don't believe people about the speaker capabilbiy.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It isn't high quality for playing music but it is fine for reading applications if the room isn't too large.,"1,2,6",C,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,4,It might not be loud enough for a double room like a kitchen open to a living room area especially if there is a lot ambient noise.,"1,6",C,,
B01DFKC2SO,2,You would think by now it would be able to answer questions but it doesn't even asked a simple question as what's the number one song out right now and she couldn't even answer it she said I don't know,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"With a smart phone, an iPad, and a laptop, I found no real use for this.","3,4,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,"Also, with folks talking about their microwave ovens spying on them, I was uncomfortable with always have a continious open ear in the room, often offering unwanted comments or answers to questions not asked.",2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,3,Returned.,8,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,It's  ok for $50 I'm glad I DIDN'T give more than that for it.,3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1,"It comes on by it's self when u least expect it to, it tells you that it don't know how to help you when you ask it to search for something and it also don't play all of a sermon when you try to listen to one from Ref Net, breaks up a lot when playing or it just stops.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1,Didn't like this always having to reset so we went with Echo big one and love it,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3,So far just meh... Not sure if there is an issue with mine but Alexa hears me ask for things and starts to respond and then just stops and is unresponsive.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,She'll start playing music I ask for and it will play a few words and then stop.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,3,WiFi signal is strong... Not sure if anyone else is having this issue.,2,,Inquiry,
