Called Go-pro for help and was assisted with a manual install that did not help. Go-pro then wanted me to complete the warranty and replace the unit I had. I am returning this product if this is my first introduction to their product and it could not work then I do not want to own this.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|35|December 26, 2014|Disheartened frozen GoPro owner :(|We're in the Maldives for our once in a lifetime vacation and our brand new GoPro HERO4 isn't working! We tested it out twice before leaving for our trip and it started freezing up as soon as we landed in the Maldives. :( Thankfully our hotel has internet, so we tried all of the troubleshooting steps on GoPro's website to no avail. The camera freezes up even without a SD card inserted, so we believe it's a bad camera. We reached out to GoPro support with a detailed email of issues (including the fact that we're using one of their recommended micro SD cards) and that it freezes up even without a SD card inserted. GoPro support responded with "From the information you have provided, I would say, not for sure yet, that the problem is your SD card, can you please send us a photo to check which one you have." Seriously? We bought the GoPro specifically to take underwater footage of our scuba adventures here. Now we have nothing to document this trip we've saved up for/planned for the past 5 years! So disheartened. :(
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|3|February 24, 2015|GoPro hero 4, severely dissapointing|The camera froze the first time it was used after charging the battery, I would seriously consider buying this model - research all the blogs about this unit freezing.  When I sent it back in I was told that the warranty department had no units available to send.  now that I have experienced this problem I did some research with people that I saw had bought a hero 4 and a majority of people said they had a similar problem.  Quite amazing.  So BEWARE, and do some research before buying.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|1|November 16, 2016|wi-fi wouldn't turn on|I bought this unit in Dec of 2014, and I probably used it maybe 4 times, nothing strenuous: snowmobiling,Ski trip once and now the wifi on this unit won't turn on no matter what I try. I must give kudos to customer support who really tried to help me out, but without wifi its really inconvenient to use this device. Did a quick google search and seems like there are many folks like me having the same issue.

B00NIYJF6U|1.0|3|August 22, 2015|IF it works: you will miss basic functions. Mine: a piece of crap|My camera started failing after a few shots, it would freeze every x amount of shots and the only way to get it to work again was to take the battery out -something not very convenient when you are diving or doing anything else u are supposed to be doing- and then it started freezeng every less shots, to rhe point that every 2 to 3 shots, i had to take the battery out... so i returned the piece of crap... at that price range, the camera should have at least some basic functions that cameras 8 years old have and work normally. I will not buying again from Gopro.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|5|February 27, 2015|Don't buy this garbage camera|This camera is garbage.  I have posted several reviews and this is the first 1 star rating. This camera has crashed from day one.  I should have returned it immediately but hoped that we would get it straightened out.  It freezes all the time, rarely is recognized by the computer when plugged in.  GoPro support is non-existent.  Go to their site and you will see for yourself. My GoPro doesn't suffer from the numerous hardware problems that others have experienced.  It just crashes all the time.  I keep hoping I may be able to connect it to the computer and somehow get a software update to fix this mess.

B00NIYJF6U|1.0|1|May 7, 2017|Came with Defective Wifi|When I use my camera with Wifi on, there is a pulsing audio sound captured in the recording. A quick Google search reveals this was a widely known problem by that GoPro was aware of at least a year before I bought by camera. It has been 18 months since I bought my camera. Today is the first time I used the Wifi and I discovered the problem. Even though it's past the warranty period, I'm going to submit a warranty claim to GoPro. I'll update my review if they make it right and fix my camera or send me a new one. If they won't take care of what was a known issue before they sold me my camera because I didn't submit a warranty claim within 12 months, I'll never use their products again. It's a shame because I was happy with this product until I found this out today.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|2|April 20, 2015|Turns on but the screen does not transmit anything from the lens and does not respond|Because of difficulties in sending the camera received on Wednesday 15 April. Following the instructions of the camera, loaded the battery and put the micro sd 32 gb class 10 brand Samsung. The camera turns on but the screen does not transmit anything from the lens and when menus are manipulated application hangs and does not respond, so you have to turn it off or remove the battery. I need to know how you will resolve this issue me because the product is under warranty for one year. It was acquired by Amazon according to the order No. 109-0544668-4118645, which was delivered to the warehouse in Miami, USA. on 13 January. The order indicates that the product is sold by: Amazon.com LLC. The manufacturer Gopro already been reported under Case #: 01202790. After receiving response procedure to solve the problem, could change my opinion and product qualification.

Happens usually right after startup before I have a chance to begin recording.  Amazon won't exchange because it's after 30 days, yet GoPro has a 1-year warranty on these cameras.  Very disappointed.  I like the camera; I just want one that works.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|0|May 21, 2015|Flooded case at 20 feet.  NO GOOD FOR SCUBA|Bought the GoPro for a scuba dive trip to Mexico.  It worked well through 8 dives to 85 feet.  Video was pretty decent with good color using the WoCase Lens Filter.  Photos were not very good in general.  On the 9th dive, in a Cenote (fresh water cave) with a max depth of 25 feet the case flooded about 20 minutes into the dive.  Since I was in a cave I could not surface immediately.  So far, I have been unable to recover the GoPro.  It is sitting in rice.  VERY unhappy with my choice to go with GoPro for SCUBA.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|1|September 1, 2016|Only use if you are within 2-4 feet of what you are shooting|this is the worst Camera I have ever bought. I have not played with it that much but I brought it with me to Comic con and I will never bring it with me again. I was clade I brought a back up.  I would return it but I already pulled the stickers off. You had better hope what ever you want to film is within 2-3 of you.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|2|March 25, 2016|Great pics but mine died for no reason after two weeks|Product stopped working right before the vacation I bought it for now I'm stuck with it and wasted 500 dollars between the camera and accessories
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|6|June 12, 2015|So much for a vacation movie.|Decided to splurge for my 5 year belated honeymoon to the Brittish Virgin Islands and get the toy that I have always wanted. When I got it it was amazing, I immediately took it out and filmed my dog, took stills, everything worked great, until it started freezing, so I had to power cycle it a few times, no biggie. When I got home I researched the freezing, and even though the SD card i bought along with the camera was recommended I decided to go for the top of the line just to make sure that nothing would go wrong on the trip. Boy was I wrong, every other time I would try to take a picture it would freeze and I'd have to power cycle it. Every other time in video mode it would start recording, but only record for 7 seconds and then freeze, completely fooling me and the past 10 -20 minutes of footage that I thought I was filming. When the camera did work it was great, but at the end of our 7 day vacation, it just sat in my backpack waiting to be shipped back. I bought the camera 2 days before I left for vacation, so I wasn't able to really see how terrible this camera was going to be. I bought 2 of the recommended SD card, ensured everything was up to date software and firmware wise. I thought this was going to be the perfect beach vacation companion and turned out to be a great paper weight. This is quite a common problem with this device, my advice, STAY AWAY.

The camera keeps freezing up even after updating the firmware severally. I send my complaint to gopro and they have asked me to send it back for an exchange only problem is that I am in Nigeria and I will probably be charged AGAIN for custom fees. I wish I didnt buy the damn thing! Don't make the same mistake I did!
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|2|August 6, 2016|It is a great little camera if you do not get a lemon|Buyer beware. For many this camera freezes up. I used my successfully 1x and the next time that I wanted to use the camera, it freezes and will do nothing. I followed Go Pro instructions to try and solve the issue and no success. Be sure to check out Youtube videos on the number of people who have had this problem. It is a great little camera if you do not get a lemon. If you do, you are stuck with it if out of warranty so be sure and get the warranty rather than be out $400.00.

Which amounts to a plastic mount in place on the windshield!  What a gimmick.  The first go pro ordered, would record for a little over an hour, then dead.  The camera became so hot I could hardly touch it to get it out of the case.  Returned it and another one came very quickly.  The time it took me to set up the first one, package it to send back, coordinate with UPS and then set up the second one ... and it won't hold a charge either.  Something about this camera or faulty battery is absolutely ridiculous, and what a huge price to pay for junk!  I have charged it on the USB port, the plug in usb adapter and it will turn on briefly and dead again.  $400 and more of my time to try and make this work, potential of setting up another one?  Don't have time to keep messing with this expensive equipment that doesn't deliver!!  Guessing maybe they are getting rid of old stock and really don't care about the customer.!

B00NIYJF6U|1.0|2|July 4, 2016|Simple is better|Within months and only a few uses the camera started showing me a black screen and not taking pictures.  I paid way too much for this item for the Gopro not to work. I contacted Gopro and they had every excuse in the world why it may not be working. What a pain in the butt! I was overly excited to buy this and very disappointed!! For the record It was in a lifeproof case it's entire life! Barely used in the water! Maybe gopro hasn't figured out the LCD screen yet.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|1|November 3, 2016|Missing 16gb memory card and battery charger.|The product description said it includes battery charger and 16gb memory card. But I did not find it in the shipment.

And yes, I have tried different SD cards, all of which were the recommended class. In fact, I emailed gopro directly and gave them the specific name of the cards I was using and they replied that those cards should work! Am still trying to figure out though why only Gopro cameras are plagued with this problem (other cameras may have this issue occasionally but Gopro has seemed to corner the market on 'Card Error'). Of course what this means is that the sport cam that you bought to capture moments that may be impossible or very hard to get in the future (scuba diving, aerial shots, rock climbing etc.) will have you pissed when you're looking back at your footage and realizing that you got 18 minutes of your hour long adventure. Moreover, none of the features in the cam (FOV, FPS, Protune etc.) will matter because Card Error will result in you not getting the footage in the first place!!

B00NIYJF6U|1.0|3|February 11, 2016|Have no idea how something that costs $350 dollars can have so many problems|I bought my GoPro and it came in Tuesday.  Long story short, it literally had every single problem that you could find on the reviews here. -Camera overheated -Helicopter noise after recording with the wifi on and then downloading onto my phone -I spent two hours messing with my camera and trying to connect it to wifi.  In roughly a two hour time span I got it to connect to my phone and able to record using my phone but after having he preview on my phone for 15 seconds it'd freeze and the GoPro itself would freeze up. I am getting a return and hopefully the new one works how it's supposed to.
B00NIYJF6U|1.0|5|April 12, 2016|Too Many Glitches.|Nothing but glitches with this camera. It constantly freezes up when connecting or disconnecting through the usb port. The only solution is to pull the battery out and reinsert it. The GoPro phone app only connects occasionally through the wifi connection. Videos that are clearly on the camera will not download through the GoPro app. It is hit and miss. Yeah, the video looks good, but what good is it when you cannot consistently get it downloaded to your computer? I am very disappointed with the function of this camera. I now also have a ton of accessories I bought to go with the camera that have to be returned. Nothing but a hassle.

B00NIYJF6U|2.0|9|March 14, 2016|Gopro issue|I bought this gopro camera to use for an upcoming vacation. I decided to try it out at our daughters winter guard performance. When we got home and hooked it to the HDMI cable that is attached to our LG smart tv to watch it, the video froze after about one minute of the four minute performance.  We called go pro tech support and they informed me that their engineer's were aware of the problem and said they "might" get the problem resolved in the future. We were told we would have to record the videos in a lower resolution in order to play it back on our tv. It is unfortunate to spend this much money on a video camera that will not perform as advertised and have to settle for a less quality video output. We are not very pleased with what we have found out and just feel it is something that others who are looking at this product need to be made aware of before making their purchase.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|0|August 7, 2017|Died one month after replacement plan ends|Worked bellow expectations for one year with consistent overheating in the most average of weather. Continual issues with turning on and off and locking up. I used it as a dash cam, the simplest of labors, but it still managed to disappoint even there with a constant air of unreliability. And finally, the kicker, one month after my very expensive replacement plan runs out it completely falls apart, with sd errors that make it completely unable to use no matter which sd I use it for. I spent months researching the best camera for my needs, but I suppose my conclusion was way off. This camera has been a sour expensive experience since day one. I'll stick to the cheap stuff from now on. At least they don't make you go broke for their shoddy craftsmanship.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|1|June 21, 2017|External microphone ports never work|I have purchased two of these cameras and neither one of them worked for external audio. I have a drawer full of microphones and microphone adapters and none of them work.  I recently purchased a Drift ghost S it has a 3.5 mm microphone Jack on it no need for an adapter I do not know why GoPro can't build their cameras the same.  The video is excellent though but not being able to run a microphone into my helmet is a problem for me.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|1|December 30, 2016|Bad audio when using the Wifi setting.|Buyer beware. I used the wifi with it recently and noticed a thumping or helicopter like sound on the audio. Turns out this is a common issue with this camera. No way to fix it and since I'm past the 1 year warranty...looks like I'm stuck with it. If you purchase, you should IMMEDIATELY test it with the wifi settings to see if you can hear the thumping in the audio!!

B00NIYJF6U|2.0|2|February 23, 2016|Great Camera, Bad Battery|The camera is amazing, I really like it and it didn't take long to figure out the basics. At first I wan't sure about purchasing it due to some reviews of recieving a defective camera with a purple screen and was debating on getting it locally. However, I have been using the camera a lot in the past couple weeks and not one problem. The reason for giving it a two star is the battery. I believe I recieved a bad battery, it doesn't last long at all. I'lll have it fully charged and in a few minutes it drops from 100% to 70% then about 25 minutes it will go completely dead. When I first got it I fully charged the battery before turning it on and using it and it did this the first time using it. Ever since I got it iv been fully charging it and letting it fully die and nothing is changing. Over all I love the camera and I'm glad I got it, just it was a major let down about the battery and having to stay close to an outlet.

The quality was great, but a week into the trip, the housing case's attachment tab broke off while unscrewing the GoPro from the headpiece. This ruined every shot for the rest of the trip because I was not capturing even shots (the camera was tilted). I am very unsatisfied with this product.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|14|March 9, 2015|that the solution in every case was to ship thing to gopro under warranty and they replace it and maybe you will get a good one.|I did a ton of research before buying this camera and was aware of the many reports of the hero4 silver freezing and becoming completely unresponsive. It seems from the reports I've read, that the solution in every case was to ship thing to gopro under warranty and they replace it and maybe you will get a good one. I thought just maybe I would get a good one since they have been out a while now.... Nope. nothing but issues. My SD card is officially supported and is one of the fast cards you can buy today.  Rather than jack with shipping back and forth and dealing with the hassle of that whole mess, I just returned the dang thing to Amazon and went to my local Best Buy to get one and hope for the best. Well, the one from Best Buy has tested great so far. I guess it's just a roll of the dice with this model. I figured if i got another bad one it would much easier to just go back to the local store.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|1|March 18, 2017|Have to replace lens and cover, and no charger to charge the GoPro|It works fine, except for the fact that it didn't come with a charger, the lens were VERY scratched, the cover for over the plugs, where I would put the charger, is missing. The silver cover is all scratched up and is broken at the top and it stabs me. I would recommend this product if someone has the time to replace practically everything and will but a battery pack separate. I would recommend this product for anyone who is willing to pay more to get the GoPro quality that everyone wants.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|3|October 28, 2015|LCD screen already broke!|I've had this item for about a month now.. I only use it for a handheld gimbal, and the LCD screen has already gone bad.. 5 days outside of the return policy. Ive never dropped it or carelessly handled it. Disappointed.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|1|December 23, 2015|Not Happy!|I spent 3 hours trying to connect the WiFi on the camera to the phone app with no success. Finally after talking to GoPro technical support they said the WiFi isn't working correctly and I had to send it back. I might have saved a little money buying it through Amazon, but now that there is a problem, I have to mail it back and won't have the camera for christmas as I planned!!
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|3|April 12, 2015|Dissatisfactory image quality and spotty Wifi|I bought it to take it on my runs with me when I leave my phone behind, and am a bit disappointed in the image quality of stills: Moving objects come out blurry every single time, despite the dedicated burst mode. Non moving objects and scenery look much worse than on my Note2, and even my Galaxy  Gear smartwatch, incredibly. Connecting my Android phone is more hit than miss, I have to try about 5 times restarting the camera and app, until I finally get a connection established. I would put up with it if the pictures came out better. It just doesn't seem like they used a good image sensor. I am sure it's a great camera for action videos, but again, I just need something small that takes great pictures, and the Hero 4 isn't it. I will say that pictures come out slightly better than on my Polaroid Cube. Something else that irks me is the fact that despite a bazillion accessories out there, there is no way to attach a lanyard to the camera if I use it without the waterproof case, which I don't need, and which would make the camera too bulky. I think I will return it for the above stated reasons, even though I love its small size and Wifi when it works :(
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|0|July 30, 2016|Might have got a lemon|Not sure if something is wrong with the one I ordered for my husband or if he just has no clue how to use it. After charging the battery, it went dead after only a few minutes.  Also, while playing back some video, it freaked out so he removed the battery.  Now it wont work at all!!  Said the underwater picture was very clear before it freaked out.

B00NIYJF6U|2.0|3|December 2, 2015|All Hype, little reality.|I bought the GoPro 4 Silver with the idea in mind that I was buying the best camera of this type available.  It turned out that it's a nightmare to set up and just didn't deliver on picture quality.  Note that this camera only downloads wirelessly, that's one point not made in all the tutorials and advertisements never mentioned.  The GoPro App download was different for different iPads I had, and totally wrong for one of them.  Couldn't connect wirelessly.  In general, I can't recommend buying this camera to anyone who can't spend two or three days messing around with it to get it to work...and maybe a few more days to get it to work properly...if at all.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|1|February 7, 2016|Not so easy to use|Having nothing but trouble with the WIFI, Amazon won't take it back, I may have to fight about this one
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|1|January 27, 2016|Two Stars|Poor image quality on the LCD, with stripes. Let's hope Hero5 is of better quality
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|0|March 18, 2016|Didn't like it|Way overpriced for what you get. Yes, it's very small and portable. Shoots nice video. That's it. You have to buy everything extra at an already high price. Wasn't what expected. We returned.

B00NIYJF6U|2.0|3|April 29, 2016|VERY disappointed.|The camera will not communicate with any of my computers.  Contacted support and they said to update the firmware.  Did it.  No change. I have some very inexpensive electronics that will be recognized by the computer every time.  This is simply unacceptable.  Cannot recommend this unit.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|1|May 27, 2015|Camara Damage :(|Hi GoPro team, I'm really sad because my camera was damage since the first day. I could take some photos, not good at all because the camera began to be blocked, the screen was black and the buttons didn't work. I had high expectations because I was going to use it the first time in a trip but it was a bad experience. Would it be possible to have a support contact to fix it or have a new camera or have my money back. Please let me know any comment or a photo or video as a support. My mail is dca134@gmail.com Thank you! Diana Ariza
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|4|July 9, 2015|Freezes|it worked great for the 2 out of the 4 months I've had it and now if I take a picture it will freeze automatically and now i can't use it and I am looking to return it
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|2|May 6, 2015|Freezing and faults|Worked fine for the first couple uses, then as soon as I put it to the test in the heat of the day and shaky conditions, it decides to freeze and not function. Had to remove battery to restart it, now the screen has different colored lines going through it. I'm going to sell it to a pawn shop and buy one with a warranty, since the seller offered zero and little to no real return policy.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|5|December 28, 2014|Defective Lens|Delivery was prompt but prior to even opening up the standard plastic housing, I could see a scratch over the lens area.  After opening up the housing I could confirm that the scratch was on the camera lens itself - and it was a deep scratch.  Either GoPro lacks proper product inspection processes or it had already been returned and they tried to pawn it off to an unsuspecting new buyer.  I didn't need to buy it online so I'm wondering why I did.  I'll return it and buy one from a brick & mortar retailer where I can visually inspect it first; probably a good practice for all pricy electronics.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|2|July 1, 2016|Don't buy for burning DVD'S|First off this is a great little camera for pics and the quality is awesome. But having said that I purchased this for video, and it does take the best video I have ever seen. But people be warned if you think you can take a video of an hour walk through the mountains or of a family get together and then burn it to a DVD you are in for a surprise. Even on the lowest resolution {video is awesome} you will be way over the capacity of the 4.7 Gig DVD! I was only able to get about 25 minuets of video to burn to a DVD. I read a ton of reviews and nowhere did anyone talk about burning videos to a DVD. I already have an awesome 12MP camera for pictures. Even when I burnt a 25 minute video to DVD it did not play good on my fancy DVD home player. If anyone wants a barely used GoPro Silver and accessories let me know. If I would have been able to read about burning it to a DVD on their website or any info in the reviews I would not have purchased it. Shame on you GoPro for not telling people about this.

Its all about some companies selling you things for the size and portability rather than quality.. stop holding back on the better circuitry and sell it already, not the junky toys.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|0|August 22, 2017|Silver or Black addition Gopro hero 4|This isn't the product I was sold, by comparing the silver and black addition gopro hero 4, the major difference is that hero silver has a LCD tuch screen and Black addition doesn't. But I do now own a GoPro Hero 4 silver and it is user friendly and extremely versatile, great for beginners!
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|3|October 21, 2014|Most Amazon purchases meet expectations.  The Hero4 Silver does not.|I rarely review, as most Amazon purchases meet expectations.  The Hero4 Silver does not. The windows app on my Nokia 1520 WP8.1 is a non starter on either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  I am totally disappointed, as my intended use depended on remote.  I have ordered the Smart Remote, which may somewhat suffice. If this major shortcoming is repaired, I will update my comments.
B00NIYJF6U|3.0|2|April 2, 2015|Helicopter noise is a problem.|I love my GoPro, but the helicopter noise is simply not acceptable.  It has been widely reported and GoPro still hasn't fixed it yet.
B00NIYJF6U|3.0|7|January 5, 2015|Great image quality, housing / terrible interfaces|The screen is nice for framing shots. Great image quality and totally water tight (taken it down to 35m so far). Big issue: Generally crappy/laggy interface, which I hoped they would have fixed. No remote control, unlike the GoPro 3 Silver. The app connectivity really stinks. For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to get the camera reconnected. Eventually reset the camera, which didn't work because I couldn't reset the app. Then I lost my phone - hardly the solution to that problem. Easily gets to 4-5 stars if they include the remote and fix the app.
B00NIYJF6U|3.0|0|December 28, 2015|Clear, not so steady|This gopro was delivered on time and place Properly, but the item was not as satisfying as I expected. I recorded some footage from snowboarding in the mountains which could be bumpy at times and unsteady, but I thought that this camera would solve at least a percentage of this issue. Although, the gopro presented the footage without a bit of steadiness. It was clear though!
B00NIYJF6U|3.0|0|January 14, 2016|Video is great. But if you take photo|Video is great. But if you take photo, the photo quality is really not as good as I expect. I think the photo quality is worse than my Galaxy Note 4. Considering the high price tag, I give it 3 stars. (BTW, GPro stock is only $12 now.)

I been buying products from amazon for quite a few years so is a bit of a let down.

The wi-fi remote is terrible as far as charging holding a charge 1 star or lower if there were such a rating.  My experience with the remote has lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 and could go lower depending on GoPro's technical support, I guess I find out what kind of company I'm dealing with soon.
B00NIYJF6U|3.0|0|March 8, 2017|Buy Yours From a Different Seller!|I paid $300 for this camera which seemed to be the norm when buying the hero 4 silver new, but upon recieving the package it looked like it had been opened and resealed. I ignored it, but after removing the camera from its housing I noticed how horribly scratched up the LCD screen is (picture attached). Very disappointed. So far the camera itself seems to be working fine, but I feel that it was refurbished and I've paid the price for what should've been brand new.
B00NIYJF6U|3.0|0|May 17, 2016|Three Stars|Had to RMA after 2 months :( Spent a month going back and forth with their support team and got approved for a return so they could fix/replace my new Go Pro.

Have had this issue since day one; right out of the box.
B00NIYJF6U|3.0|0|August 26, 2016|Great Until it Malfunctions|The GoPro HERO4 Silver offers simplicity of use, a nice LCD display, and great image quality.  But after six months, ours has developed a habit of turning off by itself.

B00NIYJF6U|3.0|0|June 7, 2017|Not as great as it was made out to be......|Not really a fan of GoPro......bought this one year ago and its overpriced! images from pictures are less than stellar, battery life sucks (on/off just for pictures - won't last a day)(video recording - 2 hours max), and editing images are a pain.....just downloading them from the GoPro is a hassle. 1080i videos are great, if mounted to car or videoing distant objects.....underwater the images are okay. IMO there are better cameras on the market. The GoPro Hero5 is probably the same.
B00NIYJF6U|3.0|1|March 28, 2015|Horrible battery life.|Battery life is horrible.  The video quality is better than the 3+ Black.  Unlike the older optional viewer, I can actually see this in full sun but using it drastically reduces battery life.  I haven't had any problems with the unit freezing. The 3 had the same problem after charging via USB/PC so I always use a charger.  Of the 3 Black, 3+Black and the 4 Silver, overall I prefer the 3+Black.  The battery life is the deal breaker.

I bought it for vacation in Australia and beach time and made sure it was fully charged before going on the plane.  The only time I went to use it on the trip in the beach at the end of my vacation and the GoPro was flat.  Somehow it had switched on in the bag and flattened the battery and I had no idea because I hadn't used it yet.  It was pretty irritating as it didn't get used at all on the vacation due to the flat battery so was a waste of money to have it and not use it.  I thought of using it when I go skiing and attach it to my helmet, but so far I have had issues attempting to do this - the plastic won't separate in order for me to stick it on the helmet.  I'll probably head to REI to see if someone can help me out.

B00NIYJF6U|3.0|1|February 15, 2016|Freezes up on playback to TV! Known firmware issue.|Freezes up on playback! What a waste of money. I bought the hero4 for a skiing trip. Now that I'm home I can't get the hero4 to playback on the tv for more than 10 seconds without it bricking/freezing up despite trying multiple cables, HDMI and USB. The screen turns blue and then I have to remove the battery to restart it! What a piece of junk. Playback interface is horrible, otherwise it seems to be a quality product. Battery life is pretty bad. I ended up using 2-3 batteries per day when the cam was mostly on standby. DON'T BUY - until GoPro updates the firmware to support playback. They are aware of the problem and still haven't done anything to improve it. Now I'm past the 30d window to return and stuck with a relatively nice camera I can't easily watch.

Video is great, as is the underwater capability. I only gave it three stars  because the outer case scratches EXTREMELY easily. I've had several sport-type underwater cameras over the years, and never had one that looked so bad after one week of use. I am a casual snorkeler, and it was in a case when not in use. There is no way a "sports" camera should look this bad after a week of light use.

Syncs immediately the first time, then refuses to sync after either phone or Hero4 goes to sleep.  Must go through extensive turning on and off to get it to start working with the iPhone again.  NOT GOOD when I'm in the middle of skiing, bicycling or hiking.  The last thing I want to do is tech support.  This is the only way I can tell if I have it pointed at the right elevation.  I took video of an entire bike trip with the camera tipped too far down because the GoPro would not sync with the iPhone and I couldn't tell how it was pointed.

I later purchased a Nikon DSLR that better suited my needs. Still, if you're looking for something to take on trips, or if you're into extreme sports, the Go Pro Hero is for you.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|June 15, 2016|Great camera for the all around adventurer|I have been wanting a GoPro for years. I ended up choosing the HERO4 Silver because of the night feature and the screen. I love being able to see the digital picture rather than having to just point, click, and hope for the best. The case did crask already, which I was a bit disappointed with because I was really hoping for more durability. Overall this has been very fun to take camping, hiking, diving, and so much more. I've already gotten some amazing pictures and with some more time to adjust to the wide angle lense I'm sure they will only keep getting better!

But I like to keep it simple. My favorite is the super slow mo. Don't buy unless you're into wet action sports like snowboarding, surfing, diving, outdoors, etc. It's an expensive toy otherwise. Go Pro Studio also takes some time to learn and you have to download it for windows - takes up a lot of resources.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|November 9, 2016|This is a great video camera|This is a great video camera. The film quality is pretty amazing as you can tell by all the other reviews. The only issue we have are that the sound capture is not great if you have the case on and it is mounted. You tend to get lots of squeaking in the joint area that can make the sound suck. I guess that why all the Go Pro videos have music added to them. Also this is not that good for still pixs. We tend to go back to our Iphone for still pics.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|March 4, 2017|Four Stars|coooool :)
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|2|August 8, 2015|Be a hero|Great product, my only concern is the waterproof housing isn't 100% waterproof. Still awesome would recommend it to everyone. Best when purchased with the smart remote and go pole.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|4|January 26, 2015|Nice Camera but the sound capture is not that good.|What to say about these cameras...The video quality is really good as we can see everywhere in youtube and having a display really helps fine tune the camera position. As the display  turns off after 1 minute it won't drain all the battery. The only con is the sound noises caused by the camera shaking inside the box, it could have something already installed out of the factory to avoid these shocks so I wouldn't need to worry about putting something in there to fix it. It just doesn't fell right to install rubbers and sponges on a brand new camera case to have any chance to use the sounds captured by the Hero4 Silver..
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|March 28, 2016|Good Product - Expensive Considering the Competition - Struggles in Low Light|It's a very good product. However, it's high time GoPro reduced its price. There is a lot of good competition at one-third price that cannot be ignored to remain in the market. The other thing that baffles me is why can't the sensor size be increased for better low light performance especially at this price point.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|August 19, 2015|I love my Go Pro|I love my Go Pro, just wish the battery lasted longer and had a flash.  Make sure your computer can handle the high resolution settings, otherwise you may not be able to watch your videos unless you record them with the 720 setting.  Most newer computers can handle the 1080P just fine.  Older computers, not so well.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|1|May 27, 2016|Works Good For My Needs.|I am a pilot, and I am using it to video my flights. It is costly for a camera, and low battery life, and somewhat more complicated than expected, but getting past that, a handy tool for filming activities.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|January 2, 2017|Only beaten by the Hero 5, on order, ...|Only beaten by the Hero 5, on order, the Hero 4 has operated perfectly and without a hitch from day one. GoPro should not have killed the use of my beloved wasabi batteries -1 star.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|March 16, 2016|nice camera  but cheap accessories|The camera is great for the intended purpose.  I have purchased several knock-offs previously and now I wish I had paid for the GoPro to begin with.  Clearly many features that give this camera a big advantage.  Only issue is the attachments are plastic and cheap.  Be careful or you will loose the camera.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|1|May 26, 2016|Menu Screen badly designed.|Love it but mature users with less than stellar vision beware. It is next to impossible to read the menu on such a tiny screen. The menu LCD is dark grey writing on a light grey background. Not a big deal if you are navigating via the touch screen but with the waterproof case the touchscreen is not available. No back light on the tiny front menu screen makes it difficult to read it indoors and impossible  in outdoor bright light.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|1|January 2, 2015|Great for video pictures terrible in lower light|I had the Gopro hero 3 black for a couple do weeks and sold it and bought the hero4 silver as it boasted better lowlight capability. I used it at our recent trip to Disney and universal and most of my still pics came out blurred and unfocused . In normal light pictures look great! But I was very disappointed in the quality of the pictures. Video is also great in normal light! I like the preview touch screen on the back of the hero4 silver.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|3|September 1, 2015|Love it so far|Love it so far. Square lens had some dust on the inside which I noticed after taking a few sample videos and pictures and viewing them on the computer. Took a Q-tip and cleaned dust out the best I can without removing the square housing lens. Better but not perfect like it should be. Camera without housing is crystal clear. Would have given it 5 stars if quality control was better for the housing. May be a defect in the flat glass.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|December 29, 2016|Good for what it is.|Decent quality video if there's enough light but not extremely high so not great for Pro-End looks. I, like many before, experience a problem with a helicopter sound in the video. I read others' issue and saw that calling CS helped them out... Maybe they got sick of all the returns because when I called they gave me a long list of requirements I had to do (recording video and send to them) to prove I wasn't lying. In the end I just decided that I don't even care about the audio from my GoPro so wasn't worth the red tape they were binding me with to get fixed/replaced.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|January 27, 2016|Great video quality and easy to use|Great video quality and easy to use. I was surprised how good actually. The only complaint I have is that the battery is so small and weak and the camera as a whole is so small, that it doesn't work well in below freezing temperatures for things like skiing. The battery dies very quickly in the cold...sometimes within just a few minutes.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|1|May 6, 2016|Super fun gadget but runs out of steam quickly|Okay, so the video is great and its a ton of fun! My biggest complaint and the reason I say its not worth EVERY penny is the battery life.....seriously under two hours??? This is for people who are outside and active and are going to be doing things like hikes and water sports that can go on for hours. The minimum should be 5 hours. Purchasing extra batteries is a money maker where there shouldn't be. The additional cost of purchasing extra batteries and chargers really adds up. Not to mention adding addition weight to whatever your activity is. Especially if you are going on a day hike you'll need this and then a solar charger to keep the charging in rotation. It would be nice if GoPro had a several hour battery life and all of this was unnecessary. That said you will need to buy the battery pack of two as a back up and a solar charger if you plan on doing any activity for more than an hour and 45 minutes.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|September 10, 2015|the "kleenex" of the sport video world|Well made with good quality video. Pricier than others, but I felt confident with the name-brand market leader, since I have friends who own it and are pleased. It lived up to my expectations, with the exception that some of the options for settings are not clear by their on-screen labels. This is circumvented by a visit to the manufacturer's website.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|April 26, 2016|It's OK, but has a learning curve.|Good for underwater photography, OK for video.  The case does not have a eyelet for securing the lanyard found on the red lens (used for better colors when diving) which seems bizarre considering how much this thing costs.  Hence the outer case needs some work.  This will not go into night mode automatically when going from outside a wreck to inside the wreck...a costly lesson for a Gopro noob like me.  I got this a few days before an overseas diving trip and the printed material provided is kinda crappy.  Yea, I know go online...well in a developing country that is easier said than done.  I simple sheet explaining basic functionality would have be great, but the Gopro gerus don't think so.  They would rather spend money on fancy packaging.  Go online...yea try that overseas.  It works good on land as well.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|1|September 13, 2015|nothing more needs to be said about the quality and functionality - absolutely amazing. one drawback though - battery life is pr|OBSESSED. i take this thing everywhere. nothing more needs to be said about the quality and functionality - absolutely amazing. one drawback though - battery life is pretty crap. have read all the stats on the website about usage times, but find this innacurate in real world use. eg: go on a hike - take a handful of of photos, and a few short videos, and the battery is almost depleted. always carry spares, but annoying to have to change so often
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|1|July 21, 2016|I love this camera!|I love this camera!  This is my first camera purchase since my Nikon CoolPix S630.  I bought it primarily for the pool and beach but find myself taking it everywhere now.  Before purchasing I went back and forth contemplating this one and the Session model.  Even at twice the price I think it was worth it to get the HERO4 Silver.  The back screen is great so you can actually see what you are recording.  Not to mention the kids always want to see themselves so the playback function is really nice.  Be sure to get extra batteries and memory cards if you plan on recording all day long.  With a 64gb card you will get around 4hrs at 1080p, less at higher resolution of course.  This camera has lived up to the hype I have been hearing about for yrs.  Just be aware, purchasing this camera will make you want to record everything in life.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|May 25, 2015|Recording some volleyball and paintball matches provided fun video and I enjoyed using it|I've never owned a go pro but purchased one to record some sport related activities. Recording some volleyball and paintball matches provided fun video and I enjoyed using it. I've given it 4 stars only because the Go Pro's lack of ability to zoom and constant fish eye lense limit it's usefulness outside of action related pov shots.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|October 4, 2016|Great camera, only 1 PROBLEM.|This is a great action camera and can be used in very tight places. My favorite part about this camera is the touch screen display. This feature makes all the settings much more accessible and easier to use. The only problem is the camera will get very hot with extended use. There have been reports of this ruining the camera but my camera has lasted so far (6 months)
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|September 9, 2016|Great camera, poor battery.|This GoPro is awesome.  I took it to Hawaii, got it wet, dropped it, and the quality of the picture was/is fantastic.  The only issue is the battery life.  It dies quickly.  Sure you can carry another battery, but then you yet something else you have to carry and worry about.

The only problem I had was that having the screen on drained the battery pretty quickly. I've yet to figure out how to turn the screen off to extend my battery life. I also accidentally put the camera in the wrong mode a couple times (user error. haha) so be conscious of that. Other than that, it was a fantastic investment! I used it for the first time on a recent trip to Costa Rica. I went whitewater rafting, waterfall rappelling, hiking, swimming, you name it! It beautifully captured my whole experience and I would highly recommend purchasing one.

I does it job on capturing moments. One little problem for me is the cracking of the front faceplate. It seems that this is fragile part of the gopro specially when your not careful in closing the latch of his case. We returned the unit because of this issue and replace by amazon immediately.

B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|May 29, 2017|Thumbs up|It's been a great little camera. Wish the sound could be better in waterproof case like the session
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|2|August 24, 2016|One great little camera!!!|I purchased this camera recently to use on my trip to Costa Rica; the quality of the video at 1440 was excellent so I can imagine how much better it is at 2k.  I easily viewed the videos on a TV using an HDMI cord which I had to purchase separately.  One of my complaints is that the buttons to operate the camera are very small so I keep on pressing the record button by accident.  I also had an issue pressing the wrong button and kept on changing the camera mode to other than video.  Unfortunately, I did not notice this until after recording time lapse stills instead of a video; missed recording crossing over a rickety hanging bridge to get to a spectacular waterfalls. I'm making it my mission to get this right!!! (LOL)  My most recently problem involves the GoPro application for the computer (Windows 10 sucks); still working on this issue with the vendor and hope to resolve it soon because otherwise, I will not be able to work on/save my beautiful videos.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|November 11, 2016|GoPro cameras = great; GoPro = not so great|It's unbelievable how much is packed into this tiny camera... Technology is really something. However, GoPro dominates this market and thus can charge whatever they want. At this price point, you'd expect your gear to not freeze up regularly, batteries to last for more than a few hours, etc... 4 stars simply because it is a great product... But GoPro needs to do better.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|September 29, 2016|Great for it's time, but the new one looks a lot better.|The Hero4 Silver is the best and only action cam I've ever used, but it's not without it's faults. * The touchscreen is great, but it's resolution and color spectrum isn't. Hard to tell if anything is in focus or if the colors are good. * Switching back and forth between two modes is a pain. I can see why they added voice-commands in the next version * 2.7K at 30fps and 24 is awesome. 1080p60 is a little underwhelming. For actual slow-mo you have to go down to 960p. * If this camera drops in price a ton with the new release, you won't be disappointed at all. Current price point though is way too much.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|August 3, 2016|Good: Excelent Resolution Video|Good: Excelent Resolution Video. Excelent day light picture Bad: With or without Night photo settings the pictures on night works only by tripode, and using the app. If you PUSH the botton the photo will be moved. It's not a good camera to take night photo. For this price you could get nearly Reflex camera. Conclusion: It's a perfect second camera to use in sports or water or filming but not your main camera to your holidays
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|September 1, 2016|We like it|Lots of options but I wish the camera zoomed in. We used the camera on working dogs to get a good view of the cattle in working situations but of course the video was too bouncy so my husband wore it and the video was always too far away to really get a good shot of anything. Quality of the video is good though.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|October 5, 2015|Almost 5 Star - but video in deep water being green lost a star.|Yeah yeah - can you really not give this 5 STAR - yes.? Only I would like that it wasn't silver, hate that make it black or have inserts for color.  I took it for underwater with a Sony underwater camera ($200) which takes good shots already.  The wide angle and underwater expertise made this rule.  However when deep underwater I got the green tint - sometimes- I guess in software white balance but really it ruined the video and I can't seem to take out that saturation in post.  Fix that for your star GoPro
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|June 11, 2016|4 Stars - Could Have Been 5|I would have given this camera a 5 star rating is the use of the camera was a little more intuitive. It is a quality product, just difficult to learn to use. I have 3 professional model dslr cameras and they are easier to use when compared to the Go Pro. The connection between the GoPro camera and the phone app works perfectly ...... I am happy with the GoPro Hero 4, just a little frustrated by the screens for setup and changing modes. They are very hard to see in my opinion.

Need to remove battery to resolve the issue. im wondering if this is refurbished or not coz i chose "NEW". Also, there is a big price difference from gopro website. If you want fast shipping, i recommend this.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|August 19, 2016|Very versatile cam - highly recommend.|I'm glad I removed my previous review especially pertaining to the software for mac. Used this for two week SW National Park and Old West road trip. Captured dozens of hours of POV/Dash cam in some of the most beautiful scenery this country has to offer, and aside from notable vibration, the images are spectacular. The vibration is the only reason I didn't give this five stars. GoPro needs to build in heavy duty image stabilization for a piece of equipment like this at the cost we pay.  Other than that, the only other issue I had was overheating in the desert-traveling SUV with full A/C on, and battery life could be extended. I love how they auto-shut off the viewer display while the cam is running, but it should probably have some sort of indicator on the back side that shows the camera is operating.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|2|January 24, 2015|Quality Product|My first GoPro.  Haven't tested underwater but any video or photo I've shot I've really liked.  Changing settings on the touch screen is easy; I can't imagine the difficulty with other/previous versions that don't have that option. Speaking of options, that's one downside I've found.  There are many (for a novice) to choose from.  I find myself missing or delaying moments because I'm trying to decide what video or photo mode to use.  I understand I'll learn with practice but to me the GoPro's appeal is it's ability to capture "in the moment" and I think I've missed some of those while fiddling with "super-wide at 1080p 60fps or medium 1440 48fps?" type decisions.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|August 2, 2016|Good, but not easy for me to use|Well, I bought this because I saw some amazing videos taken in Maui and thought it would be fun to make them too! Which, don't get me wrong, it was. However, the camera kept freezing, which is no fun when your diving or snorkeling or trying to view videos directly from the camera to the TV. The camera gets hot, freezes and stops working. I thought I may have a bad one, but when I started researching, I found this a typical complaint from other owners. I would have tried to return this one to exchange for a new one, but I was on vacation and didn't have any of the original packaging with me to send it back by the 30 days. Something else I didn't anticipate was the learning curve. It was a little high for me since I'm not a photographer or videographer, just a little old! LOL. I had to rely on youtube videos and the internet. The manual that comes with it doesn't really tell you how to shoot movies or to take pictures, but I guess that's true with most cameras. I just need a class! Pros: small, takes great videos, HD, good for shooting outdoor activities Cons: gets hot, freezes when trying to watch videos directly through a TV, once I downloaded videos to my laptop, it converted to mp4, which isn't compatible with the GoPro Studio, the camera only takes wide or medium angle photos, large learning curve for me (could be cuz I'm old), so it took some time learning the buttons and using all the different settings.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|March 29, 2015|Good upgrade from Hero2|Good camera; I upgraded from the Hero 2. PROS: touch screen on back; you can see what you are shooting, and playback Lots of other functions I'm still learning. Good battery life Much smaller Other mounts still work connects to my iphone via wifi (not bluetooth) via its own wifi connection (its weird; acts like bluetooth, but its wifi but doesn't need external wifi) CONS My iphone 6 doesn't connect with this.  On the boards, it won't.  I can turn the camera on and off via my iphone, but I can't see what is being shot from my iPhone 6 (older phones you can) mini SD card (Not really a con, but its my only device that takes this small size; can't swap around) Will be a PRO in the future, but now  a CON -- too many different settings that I selected a "wrong" setting out of ignorance. I'll learn

B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|June 18, 2015|Great Camera for action and water|The GoPro Hero 4 Silver is a great sports/action camera. It works best for up-close action and takes sharp video when you can keep it framed steadily on something. It's pretty pricey and on top of the camera price you still need to buy accessories if you want to get decent video out of it. And with such high quality recording options, if you want to do any editing, you'll need a decent computer. The camera is great for catching high paced action, especially up close. Just don't expect the best landscape or far away shots.

The battery life is still not the greatest but this camera has the Built-In Touch Display (hint, reason why the Silver is not great on battery life), which makes it 100 times easier to use than the Black version.  The display is very easy to use and pictures quality is really nice.  I still think these GoPro cameras are over priced but I like this one a lot.  Cannot wait to use it for snorkeling in South Florida!
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|1|October 13, 2015|Great little camera, easy to use|I bought this to replace my sealife underwater camera, which I could never get good photos with while SCUBA diving. So far am really happy. I also bought the battery backpack, deep water housing, red filter, underwater stick, and Knog kudos video light. The camera is great, easy to work, download video, extract stills. Pretty much everything I wanted. Not thrilled with the fit of my red filter as it goes over the display a bit, which leaves me a bit blind. But the quality of film is excellent---can watch it on a big screen TV and it looks great!
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|1|November 16, 2015|The good thing about gopros are there versatility|The good thing about gopros are there versatility.  Built in screen is great in this!  4k is only fps so just think of it as no 4k.  I always film at 1080p at 60fps.  Having the appropriate mounts and cases for your use are important.  I would spend ~100 additional on those and extra batteries and charger. to take filming to the next level, get a feiyu tech g4 gimbal.
B00NIYJF6U|4.0|0|February 15, 2017|Loving it so far|I got this as a birthday-christmas gift for myself and I love it. So far I've used it mainly during winter sports. Neice and nephews are learning to ski and it's great to get quality video. They also love being able to watch themselves after the fact.  I defiantly recommend getting accessories and back up batteries as it will just make your experience better. Shop around before buying...I purchased on Amazon at a good price but found a better deal a week after I got it

The baked in time lapse video settings are amazing, as well as all the variations of timed video/pictures. The biggest issue I have is the performance in low lighting situations.  The automatic ISO settings end up creating grainy pictures/videos with what I would consider fair lighting.  The night shot mode with increased exposure times, while functional, is also somewhat lacking due to the poor low light performance.  I've tried adjusting various settings in ProTune, but I still haven't been able to really get a good result. Overall, still a great camera for active lifestyles and easy videos.

The menus are great.  The one issue I have is the battery life.  It really is far inferior to every other digital camera i have ever had, dating back to the early 2000s.  This doesn't make any sense to me.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|December 8, 2016|Gopro Hero4 Review|Pros- The GoPro Hero4 Silver produces some great video for an action cam. Its great resolution and frame-rate options will satisfy beginners (me) and experienced shooters. The built-in touchscreen makes previewing and reviewing and changing settings a breeze. You can get the app and use it as a remote when it connects to the gopro. Cons- It still needs a housing to be waterproof and the battery redesign means you can't use your old batteries and battery life will still be too short for some especially when you keep the touch screen display on (it drains the battery even more). No option for in-camera digital image stabilization. Over all I am happy with the purchase and the handy new features including a touchscreen, makes it one of the best little action cameras around.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|January 26, 2016|Buy one!|NO complaints. this GoPro is amazing. Used it tons of times and the video is awesome! This version is great because of the screen on the back where you can actually see what you are shooting, but when its on the mount on a helmet or whatever, you cant see it anyway. So much fun! Even a mundane walk around the neighborhood was fabulous to watch when we got home. Super easy to use. Configure it to share your videos, or just save them to your computer. Whatever you decide - Its just fun!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|February 2, 2017|Very Cool|I just received it but it looks great and my initial sample videos are excellent.  The packaging is high quality as if you went and picked it up new at Best Buy. This is my first GoPro and the quality and feel of the camera and accessories feels excellent.  It is nice and small and the fit within the housing is very precise.  I plan on documenting my experience on my motorcycle and enjoying various other activities like the dog park and fishing trips.  Can't wait to put it to use.  Only grip is I wish battery lasted longer.  It appears a fully charged battery will last about 2-4 hours depending on your resolution settings.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|February 1, 2016|Great Action Camera|Most fun camera I've ever owned.  Use it for outdoor and sports a lot.  Works with an iPhone app, where I can control it remotely.  Get the extra battery if you're going to be away for an entire weekend.  Not a replacement for your family camera as most of the picts are of a wide - slightly fisheye view, but man o' man can it capture action.  Don't forget the right mounts.  Love it and still learning to do new things...
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|January 12, 2016|GoPro Hero 4 Silver|So I have been using the goPro Silver for a while now using just about every function it has. So far I have been really impressed with the quality and recordings it produces. I have recorded video on most settings testing to see which one I like best, 2.7k 30p seems to be the sweet spot for everyday videoing for me. Lets me crop with stabilization and downscale to 1080p and still have a crisp picture. I have used the nightlapse a few times  and have had good results after playing around with protune. In the picture settings I have used timelapse to make a few motion lapse videos and they have actually turned out pretty good as well. However you you are doing just a regular timelapse I would use the new video function for it and shoot in 4k. One thing I would say to new buyers buy the Wasabi extra batteries and charger combo for 19.99 (at the time I purchased) and a external battery pack for longer shoots. Trust me 1 battery is not enough.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|2|May 29, 2015|Great Buy !|Love this ! I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he is an ironworker. Wow what great video. totally awesome and you can wear it. I totally recommend it. I like this one better then the black one because it has better functions and he isnt using it for certin things that the black one was for. Plus in certain weather conditions this one works way better. If you work in construction or outside where the weather chnages I would get this one.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|March 8, 2016|Great deal on extreme bundle! Love this camera.|I bought this in the extreme bundle for 440.00. Since the camera alone sells for 400 at most retailers, this is a GREAT deal! You get the camera, a micro sd card (doesn't come when you buy the camera alone), 3-way tripod, two extra batteries and a battery charger pack (off brand) and the headband mount. Overall it's a great deal for first time buyers who don't have any of the accessories which are a must for this camera. Everything works well. I do have to say I've had some issues with charging the battery pack. It didn't come with an adapter for the wall and it doesn't want to charge on some adapters that I've tried.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|December 11, 2016|WORTH EVERY PENNY|EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS! SO MUCH FUN FOR PICTURE LOVERS! GREAT UNDERWATER! GREAT ON DOGS BACK! Every picture is flattering since no real closeups.  No need for photo shopping cause every picture is flattering! BEST CAMERA for action. Strong, well made, so many ways to enjoy it weather videoing in your car traveling, using the harness to attach to pets, its idiot-proof technology that is straight forward : press one button and PERFECT, and last but not least...... Drum roll please........uploads right on the spot wirelessly to other devices!  NOW THAT IS USEFUL!!!  LOVE THIS THING! WORTH EVERY PENNY!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|November 5, 2016|Amazing camera|Amazing camera. I love shooting in 1080p super view mode and getting the wide field of view. The footage is very clean and stable. The touch screen options are intuitive and easy to use. I much rather use this one than the black, the screen helps a lot. I can't wait to go on more adventures with it
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|13|November 30, 2014|Best choice among new Hero's|First of all as an owner of old Hero 2 series, this new series is beyond compare. The challenge was to chose between black and silver edition but now I am very satisfied with my choice for silver edition since; - Too much investment needed to play and edit 4K films and I am not quite sure whether the difference between 4K and 1920x1080 is that significant especially if there is no TV and/or monitor capable of showing 4K - Silver edition very slim and its back built in LCD panel is perfect and for black edition you have to pay another 80.- USD
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|June 26, 2016|Amazing Action camera|What to say about this piece of art. I entered into action cameras by purchasing a low end alternative to gopro. When i must admit it did all it promises (sjcam 4000) it is not close the the features set your get with GoPro Hero4 silver. This camera is just amazing. It has everything that hero4 black has plus a touch LCD so what else do you need? Black has addtional 4k recoding options that silver doesn't but to be honest- there is no limit to how much more you can want. I own a full frame camera and it just never is enough. So, you gotta settle at some point and trust me for the action camera world, hero4 silver is the nissa GTR. The best with a little lesser price point.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|3|August 19, 2015|How did i live without this camera?|I bought this for a trip to Mexico and it was everything I needed. Waterproof, small form factor, took great photos and very high quality HD video. I got the package deal with 2 extra batteries and a charger for the same price as just the camera so you can't beat that! Batteries last about 2 hours of filming which I found to not be an issue with the extra 2 I got in the package. The camera itself is great I love the display on the back and it was super easy to get it set up and take great high quality video. If your looking for a small 'Action Camera' don't get a knock off, buy the real deal! Highly recommend!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|December 16, 2015|but excellent for action video|Does everything I want and need as advertised. Doesn't replace a point and shoot camera for getting landscape shots, but excellent for action video, wide angle landscape shots, selfie shots, and time lapses. Gopro editing software leaves a bit to be desired but the camera is exactly what you expect. I have had it for about 6 months and have taken it on my dirtbike helmet for some trails and fields, strapped it to the exoskeleton of a buddy's off road vehicle for some river trails and rock climbs, put it on the dash when we rented a car overseas and got some sweet time lapse video, and carried it on several hikes and a few other adventures. Wouldn't have been able to do most of these with any other camera.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|February 16, 2016|Love this camera & highly recommend!|Love this camera! Love learning to use it! Great video and audio on this little camera. I was surprised how small this thing was. It is smaller than a 3x5" index card, about half the size. I wanted one of these after I saw photos other scuba divers took with their Gp Pro cameras. I received this as a gift from my spouse with a bunch of accessories. I'm anxious to use it when I go diving this summer in FL and AL areas. I'm sure it will live up to its hype and will update my review accordingly. I plan to use mine for scuba diving, kayaking, hiking and other outdoor activities.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|October 14, 2015|but it always has limitations - like trying to use a wi-fi connection in the water ...|After using a camera without a video back, I found using the Hero4 Silver a 1000 times easier because of the video back.  Sure most camera have a wi-fi app that you can use to frame a shot and see what you are recording, but it always has limitations - like trying to use a wi-fi connection in the water (hint - it doesn't work).  Using the video back is much, much easier.  You can also replay recorded clips with the back, so you can review what you just shot without having to figure out how to get the video onto another device to view.  This is extremely important and allows you to be confident that you really got the shot you wanted. After using the Hero4 Silver with the video back, I will never go back to using a camera like this without a video back.  At least not as my main recording device.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|December 16, 2014|Best Gift for Traveler|Quite possibly the best purchase of 2014. It has lived up to the expectations and honestly beyond. I gave it to my boyfriend, on thanksgiving, as an early christmas present bc we had a few trips planned and i thought it would be nice to break it out while we traveled. Not only has it become an essential on the pack list but it goes everywhere with us. While the camera is amazing with excellent clarity and durability I figured a few accessories would be imperative to the quality/variety of photos. So far he has loved the Joby Gorillapod Flexible Tripod, CamKix telescopic pole 14" to 40", twin pack of extra batteries and charger, and a spare tripod mount. Next on the list of accessories is the remote - while the gopro app has the option to set burst/continuous/video settings and take a picture it can take a minute to connect and is not ideal for all situations. Highly recommend this camera - it is versatile. I plan on gifting one to my father and mother who are less than tech savvy but love the great outdoors and live on the water with beautiful sunsets they look forward to capturing.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|June 16, 2017|You can't go wrong when you're buying a GoPro action cam.|What more can you say about GoPro they had the top-of-the-line when it comes to action cameras.  I've experienced the same excellence than many thousands and millions of people have experienced with the GoPro hero's silver.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|August 25, 2016|Great Camera for pictures and video|I love this camera! The video is amazing and pictures are great. I tested the video on 1080 and 720 and both look great on a large flat screen TV. I took it in the ocean and pool and the water proof cases worked perfect. I would suggest getting some of the accessory attachments though. The one I like the best is the floating handle. here are 3 cases and one is completely waterproof and one is more water resistant. You can't control the back of the camera settings with the completely waterproof case. With the water resistant case, you can sometimes change the settings, but sometimes not.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|September 21, 2016|More pro's than cons!|One of the best investments I've made this year. Because of its convenience and sturdy case I dare to take it with me to events where delicate cameras would be at risk. The GoPro is good at capturing action and delivers really nice 'non fisheye' footage as wel. Performs great at daytime, not so good in low light conditions. If you plan to record audio you should consider using an external microphone, or only film in quite environments so you can boost volume during editing. If the circumstances are right, the audio is pretty good! While using the closed case you shouldn't bother trying to record any audio. The screen is small but really nice. Settings can be easily changed on the go and even playback is decent on the tiny screen. If you install the GoPro app this camera can stream media to the phone for playback and pointing the camera. Changing the settings with the app is also possible.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|September 8, 2015|I Wish I Had 5 More GoPros!|I purchased the GoPro HERO4 Silver for my wedding videography business at the beginning of the wedding season. I was reluctant, because I had heard mixed reviews and I wasn't sure how it would fit into my business necessarily. I decided to give it a chance, and it was one of the best business decisions I've ever made! This camera is an absolute blast, and something that I've recommended time and time again to friends and family. We use several HD cameras while shooting wedding footage, and I was concerned about the quality of the GoPro not stacking up.. I was pleasantly surprised, and to be honest blown away by the quality of this compact camera! We've had a great time with it, and utilize it for the difficult shots! We've also recently started handing off the GoPro to members of the wedding party to take on the dance floor to capture some dancing footage! We would have NEVER dreamed of handing off our equipment, but the GoPro is so indestructible we feel confident we can share it! Our clients love that we've started doing this, because it adds a great perspective and we love that clients feel comfortable using the camera! It's so user friendly, we never have to explain it to anyone! They generally just have a sense of how to use it right away! I've used the GoPro on several hikes, kayaking, and on various adventures! I'm so impressed by this company, and I would love to have 5 more GoPros! I would recommend this to parents wanting to start their kids off with a great / fun camera, serious adventurous looking for a camera that is up for the challenge, photographers, videographers, filmmakers! Basically, anyone looking for a great investment and something that will hold up! It's a tiny camera, but incredible power! So impressed!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|2|August 13, 2016|READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY|If you're thinking about getting the Session or the HERO4 Black, DON'T do it. The session has worse video quality than the two, and unless you really REALLY need a small cube, the Session is useless. The Black is GREAT for shooting in 4k... for 30 minutes before the battery dies on you. Unless you're planning on taking 10 batteries with you, the Black isn't worth it. In addition, the HERO4 Silver has a LCD touchscreen, which (if you're into photography) you can line up shots and make sure your finger isn't in the way. I have taken an entire DAYS worth of photos and videos on the HERO4 Black before realizing I had something in the way. Save $100 from the Black, and get the Silver  -Sincerely, from a GoPro and REI content creator. Check out my shots on Instagram if you need examples of the quality. IG @joshmalech
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|3|June 19, 2016|Thumbs up!|What is there to say... it's a GoPro, it's awesome! Yes there are much cheaper options available out there that are advertised as similar, but if you're serious about shooting quality videos spend your money on this. I prefer the LCD touchscreen so the silver was the best option for me. The option to control your GoPro through the phone app is really neat too!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|2|July 16, 2016|A great goto camera for movies, wide-angle and water!|Had this for a year+ now and must say I continue to be impressed by the quality of the shots I get (given it's size and lens). I have a couple of DSLR bodies and lens - both capable of HD movies - but this GoPRo is my "goto" choice for movies. It is also my goto choice for wide angle shots (what it is built for) and of course, I use it when I will encounter water that would kill my DSLR's. Got a great movie of a waterfall - from the bottom on a boat - even though I was getting drenched. The only negative is the "sparsity" of buttons - even thing is controlled by 3 buttons and that takes a bit of getting used to. But it is pretty much required by the waterproofing. I also use it for "candid" street shot photography with a belt or shoulder strap attachment.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|2|August 17, 2015|not bad for my first try|Just shot some video from my motorcycle helmet , not bad for my first try. The GoPro app for iPad is perfect for viewing and setting up video and picture modes. The only thing I wish for is that they update the camera so you can mute the audio while recording , that would be a plus, it would reduce the wind noise, tomorrow I'm going to hit the ocean with it for the first time, I'm sure all will work out fine , I already can see I'll be coming an GoPro action hero, and it will become a good exercise machine. Buy it you'll love it!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|October 1, 2016|Must have for the adventure type or who like to capture video memories|A good selfie stick and an iPhone is cool and all, but for the people who would like to catch everything you need a go pro. Has yet to fail me on my travels, i especially bought this for my ocean trips. I like to constantly stay doing water activities and long drives where I do not have to keep an eye on the camera. The smaller versions do not carry a screen , but this one does and it helps a ton. It's always good to look back at what you are taking instead of taking a wild guess and regretting it later. Must have for the adventure type or who like to capture video memories. You can also set in in video and photo mode so it does both at once. Use a 128gb sd card so that you do not run out of space.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|5|February 6, 2016|Must Read|Ummm. Where do I start? Let me start by saying I receive my package super early. 4days before original delivery date. Bought it for a Valentines Day gift for my boyfriend. Came sealed, new and all accessories were included. I was so excited receieving this product and even more excited about how perfect it was. My boyfriend will love this gift. Thank youuuuuu
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|3|July 28, 2015|Best GoPro Yet|The GoPro HERO4 Silver is my favorite GoPro so far. The Built-in screen makes this the perfect recreational camera for those looking to get better photo and video with less effort. The Battery life is comparable to most of the other 4s. I have taken this to the beach, river, skiing, overseas, and just out on the town with friends. I use it for my professional video work and for personal keepsakes with my family and friends. The two best accessories I bought for this were the production mount and the Wasabi Power Battery 2 Pack. Gaining added recording time and always having a spare battery makes the camera much more valuable. I love the ease of use with the updated GoPro app and the functionality of the high res video and time lapse features.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|March 4, 2017|Great scuba diving camera.|I replace a GO PRO 3 with this camera and I must say the difference in the quality of the pictures it takes is outstanding.  Lots of great feature too.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|March 15, 2016|Wow, That's all I can say.|Very easy to navigate around the options but one thing I would highly recommend is "get to know your gopro before your big adventure". Watching videos on tips on navigating and how to take selfie shots came in very handy. I had the camera in the case a lot during our trip with the solid plastic door on it so the only way to get around the options was using the three buttons. After a few days of using the buttons I was able to navigate around pretty quickly. Great shots and videos with both medium and wide angles. Although don't expect the take great night pictures with this, they get very blurry but during the day is a completely different story. Try it, you'll have a great time with it.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|March 26, 2016|I love my GoPro Hero 4 Silver|Great Product! I purchased my GoPro Hero 4 Silver for a winter trip to Montana. I got great pictures and perfect high quality videos, I wish i would have watched more video reviews to understand the different settings. But this thing can do it all, and the LCD touchscreen works perfectly. The LCD is perfect for seeing what you are taping and framing your shots then it turns off after a couple minutes to save battery. If I would have went with the black i would be disappointed because without the LCD the GoPro is a little hard to navigate. The battery works for about 1 hour 30-45min of filming in 1080p by 60 so do buy some extra batteries. Cant wait to continue using this thing in all different sports and activities!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|September 3, 2017|Extremely good product!|Being used to GoPro from the beginning, this is par for the course.  It's a damn good course to be exact.  It's  hard to grade this since all GoPro cameras work great in the latest generation.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|4|December 5, 2014|but am really glad I did|I just received my Hero 4 Silver.  I have to give gopro a lot of credit for improving the menu on the Hero 4 silver.  I also have a Hero 3 Black, but have always found the menu selections confusing.  The Hero 4 Silver has really fixed that problem.  I debated up upgrading, but am really glad I did.  It is worth your time and money to make the upgrade.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|February 2, 2016|My favorite GoPro yet!|I LOVE the Hero4 Silver. I had a GoPro Hero but wanted to upgrade to something a little better to take to horse shows and on trail rides. It is perfect! I have taken it swimming, to multiple countries, and on some wild adventures. It has held up with 0 problems. Just remember to save battery life by turning the LCD screen off. I will be purchasing a second one soon!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|August 3, 2016|Love It!|GoPro Hero 4 Silver Rocks! For the price,best in it's class for size, video quality and sound as far as I'm concerned. Will record audio in stereo with the optional external mic/line-in USB cable ($20). I like it and thinking of getting another one for hunting season. I also purchased the GoPro Remote control which makes controlling the camera easy plus it will control up to 50 cameras (sweet!). Record time is OK, about 2-3 hours but do yourself a favor and buy another or two extra batteries and maybe 2 or more 64GB Class 10 or better Micro SD Cards (This camera does not come with a Micro SD card).
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|4|June 24, 2016|...

Much better. Yes it is price but so worth it. So much more you can do
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|October 9, 2015|Fantastic camera that's easy to use|As a n00b to the GoPro camera line, I can report that the learning curve isn't too steep and the Hero4 Silver camera takes stunning video with little babysitting required.  My principal concerns when buying the camera were that the battery life and card capacity would not measure up to advertised performance, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that these numbers are reliable.  I also worried about low-light performance, but obtained entirely satisfactory footage with ISO limited to 800 using ProTune settings (2.7k, 24 fps) in some very poorly-lit interiors of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.  GoPro's video editing and importing software is easy to use and recommended.  I also recommend that anyone who buys one of these cameras first checks for firmware updates when it comes out of the box.  I had to update mine.  Luckily, the process is handled effortlessly through the GoPro editing and importing software.  I am not really a fan of the big LCD screen; with a limited power budget and an easy-to-use menu on the front of the camera, I suspect most users will ultimately turn the rear screen off.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|June 12, 2015|The best!|The best action camera on the market! It also works a great video camera replacement. Like: - small and compact - waterproof housing - TONS of settings to get the perfect shot - expandable storage - replaceable batteries - free editing software for Mac + PC - mobile app is awesome for quick posts, edits, and control - new sensor can "crop" the video image during recording to give a traditional video camera look (instead of the fish eye) - SLOWMO!!!! - great 3rd party support Dislike: - expensive - many relatively inexpensive accessories aren't included standard (standard tripod mount, etc) - accessories are EXPENSIVE (most are just molded plastic) - battery life is wanting. 1 hour of shooting isn't a lot - doesn't call my parents and check on them
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|September 5, 2016|Great camera for snorkeling.| Took it with snorkeling in St John and worked great for me.  I'm happy with the photos and video, which is much better than other efforts. (Haven't figured out how to edit the video yet). But the camera is relatively easy to learn to use. I used an extension stick and floats. Seeing the viewing screen is marginal when the camera is extended away from you, so make sure you practice so the point of view is what you want. You can see my angle was above the "tang gang" and the shark surprise! Adding a couple unedited photos and video. Water clarity, depth, and sunlight make huge differences.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|January 5, 2016|If you'r ethinking about it, DO IT!|Absolutely love this! This is my first GoPro and I am hooked. Small, lightweight and fun to use. With all the different attachments and mounts there are, the possibilities are limitless! Shoots in amazing quality and has a good field of view for such a small video camera. Love that it has the screen so you can check what you are taking a picture and/or video of. I have a few friends that have older versions that don't have the screen and they all said they wish that theirs did for that very reason.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|July 24, 2016|I love it.|I love this thing. I was really reluctant to buy one because I am not going to strap a camera to a bicycle or my head or anything like that. I use it for the family and I am very happy. The size and video quality is great and I carry it almost everywhere. If I have any complaint is that if you want to use it outside the housing, it is not well protected, and it is easy to accidentally get finger prints on the lens. I bought a metal protective housing that includes a UV filter and lens cap that makes me feel a little safer. Again, I am really happy with the product overall and will most assuredly buy future models.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|August 6, 2017|Amazing video quality and easy to use!|Quite the amazing device! This was an upgrade from my Hero +...so you can imagine all of the features I am having to learn. It was a toss up between the the Hero 4 Silver or Hero 5 and in the end I got the Hero 4 Silver because it suited the needs for which I was going to use it. I am videoing my races (5Ks to 1/2 Marathons for personal accountability and memories) I knew I wanted a gimbal and the Hero 5 is still having issues with the Karma and Microphone placement/sensativity. I am very pleased with the performance so far!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|3|July 6, 2016|Awesome underwater and action videos!|Took this baby on our overseas vacation and it worked great! We have great underwater videos and action photos/videos. It's durable, light, and easy to  carry everywhere. Tried to use as an indoor camera in low lighting and found out that wasn't the optimal condition for this camera. Definitely an outdoor camera. It came with a head mount and chest mount that we didn't really have a use for. Bought a separate monopod for the GoPro which we used 90% of the time. I love that you can preview the pictures and videos and delete unwanted pics/vids before wasting time uploading them.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|June 8, 2015|GoPro is the way to go!!|GoPro has always impressed me. Whether it's their awesome videos or the graphics and frame rates that they can pack into such a small camera, it's always awesome! I honestly would recommend this camera over the Black Edition because of the rear LCD screen. You are able to frame your shots very easily as well as adjust your camera's settings all from the touch LCD screen. Then when you start filming you have the option to turn off the screen to save battery. Another thing I would buy is a Wasabi double battery pack and charger. this camera is great but filming at high definitions takes a lot of battery power. Having the extra batteries is almost a must! The only reason I would but the Black Edition is if you really were just going for the improved frame rates at higher definitions, otherwise, this will be more user friendly and give you awesome video as well!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|November 7, 2016|... my first GoPro ownership and I am still very happy with my purchase even in light of the newest ...|6 months into my first GoPro ownership and I am still very happy with my purchase even in light of the newest model's release. I went back and forth on whether to spend money on what amounts to be a bit of a novelty, as a non-professional user it is a super fun and pretty easy to use camera that has the durability and small footprint to be utilized in almost every situation that you can film. I bought it primarily to do some vlog filming and offroad usage, in vlog filming or capturing dialog the GoPro is far from the best choice. I would say if you are not doing a lot of action shots this camera is better for alternate angles and B-roll footage. Even though it fell short of my expectations for my primary purchase reason, (mostly due to poor sound capture with internal mic and lack of zoom) I would make the same purchase again. This camera, although not the newest model anymore is still capable of doing so much and if you have any desire/interest to make videos your creativity will find a place for this unit in your camera arsenal. Looking back I may have went with the Yi action cam for cost reasons but as time goes on I feel that the availability of accessories and extra features allows me to have better equipment than my ambitions which is, in my opinion, better than the inverse.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|August 19, 2016|I wish I was as cool as this camera|This camera is amazing. It's silly for me to write a review when the bazillions of Videos filmed on GoPros speak for themselves. It's just really awesome having a camera that I can take surfing, skateboarding, biking, hiking, and pretty much anywhere else right out of the box. I've bought a few accessories (you'll want some kind of pole and some different mounts depending on what you're into) but it's really cool just as a rugged camera. The app makes it easy to upload and edit footage too. The only gripe I have is that the little cover for the charger input isn't attached (you just remove it completely to access the port) and I'm sure I'll lose it eventually. Otherwise, this is a solid little camera and I really love it.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|February 10, 2016|GoPro for a good price!|Pros: -Great video quality -Touch screen makes making commands way easy -Buttons are nice alternative--takes some getting used to--to the touch screen -Lots of filming/photographic options: burst, time lapse, night, etc. -Great discount for Thanksgiving! -Came with some mounts -Can sync with wifi and control from app on your phone Cons: -Audio quality when in the housing is not the greatest...not meant for audio recording -Lots of possible settings, need to do homework to figure out what is best for different situations -Box came all dented, but the product was not damaged -App connects via wifi instead of blue-tooth
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|February 9, 2015|Great Product!|Bought this for my hubby for Christmas.  He loves it and took it on a fishing excursion.  Big plans for use for fishing trips. The head mount allows for almost hands free operation.  Set up seemed easy and he was up and running with little difficulty.  Photos and videos are fantastic for such a small camera and will transfer to your iPad or iPhone via bluetooth.  Great for the techie!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|August 20, 2017|For Scuba Diving|Love this thing.  I use it for scuba diving with red filters.  What I like most is I no longer spend time getting the perfect shot, I just take a video and crop a picture out of the video.  It makes diving much more pleasant for me and my dive buddies, no more kicking coral or separating from the group.  You don't need an extension stick, just get a hand held wand.
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|0|July 15, 2017|Hero 4 Silver rocks it!|Love this little thing!  I use this along with my Hero 5 Session for cockpit recording in my Diamond DA-20.  I hook the audio cable into this camera for recording ATC communications.  My main go-to setting is 1080 @ 30fps, and I get a great picture.  The only thing this camera doesn't have that I would find useful is vibration reduction (which the Session has) to reduce cockpit vibration.  Battery life is decent at the setting described above.  This little unit doesn't heat up as drastically as the Session, and total record time is just under 2 hours with a fully charged battery. A brief word on GoPro's App for iPhone... I use the Capture app all the time and have never had issues with connections with either of my cameras.  I love the fact that you can monitor the angle, change the camera settings, and start your recording from the app itself. That being said, I would totally buy this camera again!
B00NIYJF6U|5.0|1|August 29, 2016|Absolutely awesome product and amazon had a substantially better price than ...|Absolutely awesome product and amazon had a substantially better price than we were able to find in stores. I was able to get the warranty, additional batteries, and accessories for over $200 cheaper than for the equivalent in stores. Product works great and takes incredible videos and photos. Works great and has had no issue being submerged deep in the ocean facing tough waves and currents. The waterproof case is very durable and has kept the GoPro scratch free and like new.

From what I have been able to determine, the "Home" controls, i.e. lights, door locks, is very limited and will not operate my brand name products. Dot not very useful, will go in a drawer of unused items.
B01DFKC2SO|1.0|4|January 21, 2017|Disappointing|Alexa is a really great timer & weather informant. But that's about it. I'm very disappointed in this. In order to find out information like "How much is half of 1 1/2 cup" for a recipe or "what is an alternative for baking soda" or other basic questions you have to download apps. Then you have to remember the name of the associated app with your question. (IE: Alexa, ask 'The Happy Chef' what half of 1 1/2 cup is' etc. Everything you want to ask it has a different associated app and I don't have time to remember that many apps. I use Alexa as a glorified timer and end up Googling everything else.  I will be getting the Google version of Alexa that will let me ask pretty much whatever I want without additional apps.
B01DFKC2SO|1.0|0|July 12, 2017|Meh... Wait or buy Google home|Not for every day use.  We don't shop that often, so the usefulness of this device is limited to a voice activated radio, a trivia game, a hard of hearing person who you have to repeat your question to just for the answer to be incorrect.  The dot was a deal, but I would wait until Amazon has better programming for Alexa, or buy a Google home.

B01DFKC2SO|1.0|0|July 1, 2017|weak product|The Amazon search engine is weak to say the least.  And Alexa acknowledges commands from male voices better than female.  We do not use it much but to ask for the current weather conditions.

B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|May 2, 2017|Alexa is pretty limited in what she knows|Alexa is pretty limited in what she knows.  Even Siri can answer more questions, and I don't think of Siri as being all the impressive.  Just changed my review because the sound went out on Alexa.  She can clearly hear me, but I can't hear her, and I've tried everything.  Amazon, she is under warranty.  Should I send her back or do you have a fix?
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 13, 2017|It's not as useful as it seems|It's not as useful as it seems. Siri works better in terms of natural-language processing and understanding my intent. The integrations are alright, but severely hampered by how difficult it is to remember exactly what to say. The audio quality is not great for music, and the Alexa-Spotify integration is extremely frustrating unless you use the Spotify app directly. Alexa is a solution looking for a problem, and a poorly executed solution at that.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|May 14, 2017|Great idea, poor execution. Not quite good enough.|A great concept but still very much a work in progress. The main problem is that it is unreliable as it is plagued by underwhelming voice recognition. Many times thinks that it is summoned even though there were no words remotely close to its name. It seems to have gotten worse with time (perhaps after activations increased and the Amazon service is too slow to cope). Price is good and the potential is there but the G units are way more accurate.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|May 8, 2017|Echo Dot|I am very disappointed in the Echo Dot when it comes to receiving audio  books from amazon!  It doesn't recognize the book and will not read it to me.  I am very frustrated and angry with tech support in solving this problem.  I received the Echo Dot March 26 and have had problems with it from day 1. Nothing has been done to resolve the issues and now the date to return it is past and they just kept putting me off until the time was up!  I would never recommend the Echo Dot to anyone!  It's a great idea that just doesn't work!
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|September 9, 2017|Good concept, incomplete implementation.|It's very disappointing that the Echo Dot doesn't let you direct sound easily to one of its three available audio outputs. For an otherwise high-tech device, it is odd this practical capability was missed.   Alexa use internal speaker.   Alexa use bluetooth.   Alexa use external output.   No?   Alexa, get smarter!
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|One|January 22, 2017|OK product. Doesn't work some of the times. Doesn't add much value to my life.|Not a fan. It was sporadic at best, glitched many times, and wasn't very adaptive at realizing what I wanted to say. Plus, there's not really much out there that I'd need this for anyways. Sure, it's great for setting alarms and telling it to play music on your bluetooth speakers, but these are all things that can be done with your phone and this only provides a TINY convenience factor...when it works. When it doesn't work, it's frustrating to no end. As this product is now, I'd rather be guaranteed my actions work by using a phone and doing things "the old way".
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|One|April 3, 2017|Maybe for you, but not for me.|I heard about how super great this was, but I never ask the question worded right...They it sort of spooked me...I do not like something in my house always listening!
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 22, 2017|MAY RETURN THIS ECHO DOT UNIT FOR A REPLACEMENT|This is my second echo dot. It is NOT performing like my first echo dot located downstairs. It looses connection and settings for reasons that I'm thinking are manufacturing defects. My window to return/replace this dot is closing... I'll see if this is my last time to reset my choices into this unit. I like echo dots for what they can do. Am thinking a getting a third one.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|August 7, 2017|Not such a good buy any more!|Have bought a couple of these!  They work really well!  I like my full size Alexa better but these are great for bedrooms and such! Update one died last night!  Tried all the trouble shooting steps but it still will not find the Internet.  The other one is still working fine but for some reason this one is basically a paperweight now.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|12|May 6, 2017|Sent back for repair|Edit: I sent the Echo Dot back to Amazon for repair due to the problems below, lowering my review to 2 stars, will re-write review when I get the repaired product. Works great with Phillips hue, and ifttt. I love the ability to set timers and stream music. It's truly amazing, when it works. Anywhere from 3 to 10+ times a day it will lose connection and I'll get a red ring with "Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now, please try again later." This can be solved by either power cycling the echo or waiting 10-30 minutes for it to reset on it's own. I'm a programmer/networking specialist/back end web devolper, and I have tried everything to fix it. I love it, when it decides to work.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|2|June 9, 2017|Disappointed in Amazon not standing behind their own  product|I have three dots and two Echos. The most recent Dot stopped performing tasks and I just learned that one only has 30 days to replace and there is no information about how to get it repaired.  Amazon likes to send but does not like to receive.Very disappointing as we like the product.

In the VAST majority of the promotional pictures depicting the Dot, there are no cords shown. The pics show the Dot sitting on a table, a shelf and a mantle, cord-free. Had I not signed up for a free month of Amazon Premium Music, this thing would have been returned the minute I set it up and realized it needs constant AC power to work. So, instead, it will be going back 29 days from now.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|May 11, 2017|This has been a disappointment. Alexa cannot communicate well|This has been a disappointment.  Alexa cannot communicate well.  She is hard to understand and you cannot ask her questions like Google. Nit does however if you have Amazon prime music plays your songs for you.  This part I do enjoy.  Cannot even place orders she gets it wrong every time.  Thought I could order and do other things but still order online.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|One|March 22, 2017|Google home has much better potential then Alexa|Definitely not as flexible as Google home in terms of responding. Quit working after 3 days of use. If you're thinking about whether getting this or Google home, I suggest you getting the later. Google home has much better potential then Alexa, and doesn't look cheap
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|May 27, 2017|Should've gotten the Home|Wish I'd bought the Home instead...Alexa doesn't always recognize my questions well enough to even search for them (with Bing no less, so not like it finds a good answer!). The "Skills" are mostly a joke. I do research in the IoT space and it's no wonder the data I see shows that most people use this as a way to stream music to their bluetooth speaker or as a stand-alone in the bathroom.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|September 14, 2017|Randomly stops playing continuously when set to play on loop -- very frustrating for use with sleeping baby.|We loved this device when we bought it.  We use it primarily as a white noise machine in our baby's room.  We've run into problems recently, and I have noticed others report he same problems.  First, when we ask it to play "ocean sounds by ocean sounds" from amazon music, it plays a different "song" than the one we've played for the last several months.  Second, the player stops playing even though its set to play on loop.  This is incredibly frustrating because our baby is more likely to wake up when the white noise stops.  I've searched the product support information, and can't find any solutions to these problems.  Am thinking about returning and just using a run of the mill white noise machine instead.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|June 3, 2017|Underwhelming|The Echo Dot has proven to be underwhelming. It consistently gives the weather for two cities over. When asked a factual question, it fails about half the time. The integration with other services and devices is generally poor. Although there are thousands of skills, most are essentially useless; the skills for even well-known products such as the Phillips Hue line, are painful to set up and use. Even if you stumble across a skill useful to you, you must remember the magic phrases to activate it. It does play music, but even here it often produces odd choices. I don't regret buying it as an experiment, but I don't think it is a revolutionary product. Something that actually works more consistently and broadly might be a great thing.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|September 20, 2017|Alexa not completely functional with the harmony system|Well, I am attempting to use the echo Dot with my Harmony Elite and hub. The integration between these apps is nowhere near functional. The Alexa app attempts to assign features and control that does not correspond to the harmony software setup. In my case I have multiple equipments in multiple rooms and when Alexa attempts to assign functionality it has no relationship to what room associated with what function associated with what equipment. I am working with Amazon Echo technical support to try and get the app a little more functional by allowing the user to turn off and remove some of these features that do not apply. I think the designers are overstepping their capability here. I will update this review after the process is complete.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|September 7, 2017|Love the Echo… hate the dot.|Love my echo bought the dot for my bedroom. Now I wish I had just gotten another echo for the bedroom. The dot does not hear me when I'm standing right over it. Infuriating to get it to work on a basic command. My echo works great. This dot is just garbage. Too late to return it. Guess I'll wait for the regular echo to go on sale and replace it with something that works. I shouldn't have to yell a wake word at something I'm standing right over. Disappointing.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|8|December 10, 2016|Amazon's Dot comes up short when we're talking about general ...|Amazon's Dot comes up short when we're talking about general facts. Alexa doesn't search the web for relative information as compared to Siri. I can ask the identical questions to Siri or Alexa only to have Alexa answer "Sorry I don't know that answer" or "Sorry I don't understand the question". About the only thing she does well is play and control music selections.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|April 3, 2017|Broken after the warranty...|Developed a 'static' noise that randomly occurs, and occurs often, slightly after the 90 day warranty. Device also shuts off randomly, to the point that it is unusable. I spoke with customer support and of course they are not able to solve the problem. They did offer a 'trade in' in which they would basically give me 10.00 to buy a new one.... then apparently sell them for 44.00... No thanks.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|May 31, 2017|Not very dependable!|5/31/2017  Have had Dot for 2 weeks and already we are getting, "Sorry, your Echo Dot has lost it's connection", every other time we ask it something.  Very annoying because we really don't use it much.  Considering sending it back.  Volume is nothing to brag about either.  When it does work it is fun and can be informative.  Will wait another 10 days to decide if it goes back!
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 1, 2017|Amazing, since it happens within 1 to 2 minutes- Non responsive to responsive within a few minutes, but have to reboot each tim|Half the time I ask Alexa to play certain music the response is " I'm having trouble hearing you", whereupon I unplug and replug device and all of a sudden she can hear me. Amazing , since it happens withing 1 to 2 minutes. I also experience a response " I can't find whatever artists I request, even though she has found them and played them many times before Great when it works, but interchange with Alexa still needs much to be done.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 12, 2017|Dots DON'T play well together and home automation with x10 standards is a JOKE!|I bought two. They don't communicate with each other. This is major drawl back if i want to do something basic like have all the Dots play the same music throughout the house. Or also (in my particular case), if only one dot has direct connection (wired or bluetooth) to the home audio system, I can't ask a secondary dot to output music to the home audio system through the another dot. I'm trying to setup home automation using a very common x10 standard, but it's a pain bc I need to "hack" a solution reading up on various blog posts. And it's annoying getting instructions for how to connect "Hue" devices (which I'm not using) every time I try to connect a device.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 29, 2017|Table flipping rage inducing hockey puck.|Update: this thing is a joke. It gets dumber every day that goes by and now it constantly disconnects from the internet. I've had my dot for about 3 months and it's gradually getting worse over time. It's less and less responsive to the point of me basically yelling at it to shut the damn lights off. When it works, it's great.. but more often than not, it's a dumpster fire that makes you want to throw it across the room.

That said, on a number of occasions it interpreted work calls or casual conversation as commands and responded accordingly at inopportune times.  You can disable this with the mic mute button, but that undermines the intended convenience. The morning news report is nice.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|5|March 14, 2017|Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently|Turns out the 90-day warranty matters.  Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.  It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.  I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.  Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.  There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.  Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.  Other than that failure, I've loved having it!

I can give it a command to play my music, but after that I cannot give other commands and I am told by the device to try later. Within 20 minutes, it stops playing my downloaded music. Any attempts to rectify the problem is met with a swirling red light and advises me to try later. I have tried to reset it with negative results.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|5|May 23, 2017|Just not finding it useful|I just... don't... get it. I've had one of these since they first came out. All the tech shows that I listen to, raved about it. "Alexa, set a timer", is all I ever use it for. I've seen all the other examples. Some of the Easter eggs are funny... but I just don't have any real use for this. "Alexa, turn on..." is way less efficient that flipping a switch. Using tech, just for the sake of "cool", is just not my idea of useful.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|May 7, 2017|Didn't last long.|I ordered this in January and have enjoyed listening to news each morning. After 4 months, it started re-starting randomly during play.  Now, at less than five months, it won't respond. I have tried unplugging it, then re-plugging it back in.  It starts up, says Hello. When I start a request, the blue light comes on, but turns off after about 1 second, before I can complete my request. I am disappointed that it started with problems at 4 months, and now doesn't work at all.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|August 28, 2017|I absolutely loved my Echo dot until I realized there is ZERO ...|I absolutely loved my Echo dot until I realized there is ZERO security and anyone within range can connect their phone to your device via Bluetooth. I live in the city and countless people are always within range of my device. Doesn't everyone love waking up in the middle of the night to hear your Echo just paired with a random Samsung phone? Immediately followed by playing loud music? No better way to wake up than fumbling through your room in the dark in a half-awake stupor to attempt to turn off your Echo. Such an infuriating occurrence (that has happened on numerous occasions) and I now just keep it unplugged. Home run, Amazon.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|September 14, 2017|Defective Dot|My echo dot has never been loud enough. Not sure if I got a defective one or not but the speakers don't work around the whole base of the dot. Only on one side. I didn't expect it to be as loud as my Echo but it's not even louder than my phone. I do not recommend buying the dot. Save your money and get the Echo. It's WAAAYY louder and better in my opinion.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|September 18, 2017|Disappointed|Wow for $50 I totally expected more... first of all I have an Alexa and I LOVE that... And I was led to believe this is basically the same thing without a large external speaker.. First of all the speaker that is with is horrible basically it's like a cell phone speaker. Secondly it doesn't seem to pick up my voice very well, and at first I assumed it was just THAT unit... That was until I ended up buying one for my other child.. I'm just disappointed, Wish I would have just gotten them the Alexa's in the first place
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 22, 2017|Not for me|I guess I don't have enough Bluetooth enabled devices for this really to do much. I tested it against Google voice and Google win hands-down. I also thought I could pair it with my laptop for it to be a speaker and apparently it's the other way around so you can't do that. I can see were it would work for people that have Bluetooth enabled devices but I don't. I returned it.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|One|May 6, 2017|Don't do it. Doesn't connect to Bluetooth half of the time|Released too soon. It doesn't even connect to Bluetooth most of the time. One of my dots doesn't connect at all. They also dont connect to each other........ huge disappointment. I even bought some for friends and family. No one uses it.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|2|June 2, 2017|Two Stars|The microphone stopped working unless I was on top of it. I returned it.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|September 18, 2017|I don't love it. The speaker is terrible|I don't love it.  The speaker is terrible.  Awful.  I can pair it to bluetooth speakers, but then again, I could just pair my phone to the speakers. I also don't love that I have to buy a Prime music membership to be able to play music on it.  Prime music used to be included in your membership. I don't understand why it's not portable.  I would love to be able to move it from one room to the other to use it as a morning alarm, but it has to stay plugged in in the living room to be of any use to me at all. It definitely does not do enough to be worth the $50 price tag, particularly when it's stationary and has poor sound quality.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|One|July 15, 2017|For as long as the Echo has been out -- ...|For as long as the Echo has been out -- and the number of independent communities around uses for it that exist, you'd think Amazon would have advanced the capabilities by now.  I bought another unit for my elderly mom and I had trouble getting it connected/configured (long after configuring my own).  There is no thought to owning multiple units and the heavily dependence on referring to the Alexa App (for more on that, see the app; to clear your lists, see the app).  Very disappointing.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|2|January 8, 2017|No content filtering. Not good for households with young children.|Don't get this for internet radio if you have kids, unless you are ok with a 7 year old hearing all types of explicit lyrics. Amazon provides no way to filter explicit lyrics on the Echo or provide parental content controls. Great for adult only houses or with familes that don't give a bleep.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|2|March 22, 2017|Overall this is a fun product. however|Overall this is a fun product. however, after 3 months, alexa started turning on by itself. Oftentimes during the night waking us up at all hours. I'm past the return date so I'm stuck with it. have to unplug it each night so we don't get awakend. and no, the alarm and timer is not set.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 24, 2017|Round Radio, Square wheel|Alexa App is awful has to be plugged in to work so forget about taking it to the gym. It's a radio all the lights etc are separate purchases should be square for it to stand alone poor design laying it down blocks the speakers on it. Don't understand the good reviews waste of money. Bluetooth pairing is not happening on mine. Just use your phone for music Bluetooth to stereo on phone was simple this device won't pair. Disappointed canceled my 89 dollar echo at half price when I used the Echo Dot. Overpriced radio. Round objects roll Echo Dot needs some work.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|2|May 27, 2017|It would work so much better if you could connect to Google|Why is she so stupid. I mean like she's literally dumb. Ugh
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|March 29, 2017|ALEXA IS A POOR LISTENER|Alexa is a VERY poor listener. I purchased a few dozen books from Audible Books and it's like pulling teeth to get this stupid robot voice to read them. Some, she flat won't read and others, I need to repeat the title at least a dozen times before this dumb twit  cues them up. Other times, she cuts me off mid-sentence and says she can't find what I'm looking for. VERY disappointed........
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 23, 2017|Alexa or Siri what will it be?|The Dot is ok but nothing great. It has to be set up to my iPhone (internet) for it to work. You have to download an app to talk to Dot. This was a pain after 2 hours of finally getting it. When I spoke to Alexa it was just like Siri on my iPhone. Why do I need Alexa when I already have Siri. It was an ok product but just not for me. Thanks anyway.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|March 15, 2017|Not a happy dot owner|After a few months, just past warranty, my dot is losing connection all the time.  At first the device performed well and I was really happy and asked for a second dot for another room.  I was just on Amazon chat and all they were will to do is ,,,'As an upgrade, I will be able to get you a discount up to $20 on the purchase of a new Echo Dot as an exception especially for you.'  I explained that I did not want to lay our more money for a device that a whole lot of people are having the same problem with.  Case closed.  No one else to talk to and no resolution.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 18, 2017|Won't connect to the Net over your phone!|Don't be fooled.  This device does NOT connect to your phone, so it is of NO USE out of range of your home wifi.  After hours of trying and more hours on the phone with Amazon, they finally said that cellular hot spots aren't compatible with the Dot.  The product description doesn't make this clear at all, and Amazon has posted reviews that say you can use your phone.  Don't waste your time and don't be misled.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 22, 2017|Perhaps 3rd generation Echo Dot will do better.|Unlike Siri, Echo Dot does not understand Chinese, or any other language except English.  As a result, one cannot ask her to play songs/music which do not have an English title.  Also, Echo Dot have problem with slow speaking person.  She makes selections before one has a chance to finish one's requests.  But I guess for English-only speaking customers, she is alright. Perhaps 3rd generation Echo Dot will do better.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|One|May 12, 2017|You would think by now it would be able to ...|You would think by now it would be able to answer questions but it doesn't even asked a simple question as what's the number one song out right now and she couldn't even answer it she said I don't know
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|August 17, 2017|Bad sound, worse microphone|I have the full sized Echo and love it. Got one of these for the bedroom to play kids music during bath+dress time. It mostly just wants to play games. It's like everything I say to it comes out as "let's play a game". Exiting the game often means I have to just walk over and unplug it. Fine concept, terrible quality.
B01DFKC2SO|2.0|0|July 28, 2017|Failing after 7 months|I got this for christmas and it worked wonderfully at first. At the 4 month mark, it began to have problems.  While standing 7-8 feet away it would have trouble hearing me in a quiet room.  The lights would light up indicating it detected my voice, but it would just turn off a few seconds later without responding.  Now at 7 months it rarely hears anything I say and I have to unplug/re-plug it in every day.  I like it fine, when it works, but lately it doesn't work often.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|March 26, 2017|With a smart phone, an iPad, and a laptop, I found no real use for this.|With a smart phone, an iPad, and a laptop, I found no real use for this.  Also, with folks talking about their microwave ovens spying on them, I was uncomfortable with always have a continious open ear in the room, often offering unwanted comments or answers to questions not asked.  Returned.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 26, 2017|One missing feature away from greatness.|Works about as well as the full sized Echo in terms of responsiveness. It can drop in on other Echo devices so you can use it as a household intercom, which is really neat. The sound quality is about the same as a smartphone, which is to be expected with its much smaller size. The good news is there's an AUX out, so with a mini to RCA Y cable you can easily plug it into your stereo, and it sounds great. The bad news is all of the audio comes out of either the Dot speaker OR the AUX out, never both. There's no way to have music sent through the AUX jack while Alexa responses like weather and calendar updates come out of the Dot speakers. This means you either have to have your stereo on all the time or plug in the Dot for music and then unplug it for general everyday use. This isn't a dealbreaker, but it's a pretty aggravating oversight.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 24, 2017|Great product but Amazon needs to make some changes|Another great product from Amazon.  The only downer is the speaker doesn't pick up from more than a few feet away but I didn't buy it for a large room so it's perfect for what I wanted it for. Update:  I'd really love it if Amazon would allow multiple devices to stream their music, because this can't happen I will not buy another Dot or even an echo. Which is too bad because I had plans on buying one for each of our kids in their rooms since they love to listen to Amazon music.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|May 26, 2017|Eh, I should have just gotten another Echo. The sound quality is lacking.|The sound is not at all like the Echo.  I am still on the fence if I want to return it and just buy another echo because of the sound quality.  It works for having an "extension" for your Echo to add things to your list(s), playing your music etc.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|September 9, 2017|Meh.|We were excited to order this.. it was a novelty that wore off with the family very quickly. The voice recognition is alright, doesnt match even the Android's system. It cannot play music unless you have bought some in your amazon account.. it doesnt seem to search Youtube even. Sometimes when we watch TV, the Echo randomly wakes up, says nonsense and goes quiet again. The final straw was when one day we started getting an incoming call on the Echo (it was pulsing green and beeping intermittently). We had not informed anybody that we had an Echo at that time. Nowadays we just keep it unplugged.. not worth the hassle.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|August 5, 2017|English only, work in progress not as useful as you might think|It's a nice toy but I have yet to find a useful application for it, the Echo Dot did not work with the brand of wifi connected thermostat I had installed in my house, also Alexa only understands English which is fine for me, but not for my in laws. I can get it to play whatever music I like from several sources Pandora Radio, SiruisXM, Amazon music or my own music collection, I can set an alarm or check the weather. My in laws can just turn it on adjust the volume and turn it off.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 22, 2017|It is OK..|I love to listen to Indian classical music. Unfortunately this device does not recognize many of the popular artists. I am really disappointed with it. Today I received the Larger Echo. Hopefully Amazon will try to improve the list of international music artist list. Pandora seems to do a whole lot better job. Perhaps I need a tutorial to "educate" me to see if these devices have other featured\s that I am still not aware of.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|August 16, 2017|Designed with the modern smart phone user in mind, Computer users beware|Designed with the modern smart phone user in mind. This product does not live up to what i was hoping for due to the poor support offered to computer users. I use a cheap cell phone and a 2000.00 desktop computer as my home entertainment device. I was expecting some type of app or program for the PC to enhance the echo and i got a poorly designed web page based app that is hard to navigate and offers limited interaction with the echo. You can not even make the most out of Amazon music unlimited because the music program does not interact with the Echo. You would think a forward thinking company like Amazon would have the foresight to cover all of its customers options equally. Amazon if you read this not everyone in the world lives their life dictated by an expensive cell phone that is basically a under powered small computer. Echo is a home entertainment device not a portable speaker that should require a cell phone. If you want to take this product to the next level take the energy you are wasting on cell phone apps and design a desktop computer app much like your music program that interacts with the echo, Then you will have the home entertainment device you are advertising
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|March 30, 2017|Not bad for $50|After having the Dot for a few weeks, I have to say Alexa doesn't know much! I ask simple questions and I get "Hmmm, I don't know how to answer that".  I put a series of questions to both Alexa and Ok Google and Google answered them all. Alexa couldn't answer any. I understand  you must enable skills, and I have, but for basic questions??? Google is the clear winner here. That being said, I pay for the Unlimited  music for $3.99 and basically use the Dot as a personal  DJ. I tell her what to play and she does it. For $50, it's a neat gadget, but my next gadget will be Google Home.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|December 21, 2016|Ok, but waiting for updates to make it better.|For the most part we really love our Alexa.  It does a sorts of fun and helpful things. We have had some issues with the Nest and the Echo Dot not working together when it is supposed to and there are times when it just doesn't recognize commands even though we've don't tons of voice training with the device. I also find it mildly annoying that you can't just ask a question like,  "Alexa, what sound does a whale make?"  You have to ask her to "wikipedia" something instead and you don't get the specific info you asked for.  Kind of disappointed.  I hope they work on that feature.  I also hear that sonos is going to pair soon which will be nice.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|2|December 11, 2016|it is ok|It doesn't do a lot. It drops from the wi-fi a lot,,,, some things such as finding stores is pretty cool and playing music .......... it's ok - nothing super exciting but can be helpful.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|August 1, 2017|Great except recent update kills remote.|Bought this to use where my full Echo was having issues connecting to speakers. From that perspective, it works well. My only complaint, and while it may be "minor" to some, it is a major inconvenience for the application this was purchase for. The Dot was working with the remote, but for some reason, it now no longer does. Going through the configuration app indicates the dot and remote are connected, but it just turns on / off when trying to speak a command.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|March 27, 2017|Great little toy that would benefit by not having to find and enable skills to do everything.|I love my echo dot - it's a great price point, inexpensive enough that I don't feel guilty buying it.  I use it the most for time, timers, stopwatch, weather, shopping list, music and to find my phone.  I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night. If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.  But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.  Bad move Amazon.  If (when) google voice provides an entry price point for their Google Home line, the only advantage Alexa will have is ordering off Amazon.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|August 20, 2017|It's super annoying but turns out to be ok enough (if you don't return it first)|Hard to set up: it took more than an hour because the app couldn't coordinate the bluetooth or the wifi, kept crashing or hanging. After restarting the echo, phone and app multiple times, a google search showed that sometimes some part of android needs to be updated for the Alexa app to work. I didn't have that problem but it still took another 45 minutes to set up. The alexa app is the worst. The echo is ok as speakers go, though the bluetooth is frustrating and iffy at best (it once took me an hour to connect my laptop to my Echo because neither the app or the echo could 'find" the computer's bluetooth). It's also super annoying (and not totally clearly stated) that it's not possible to link Echos (or dots) together. Why does all of the Amazon stuff stink? Fussy, hard to use, finicky. The gear from the big G just works and is totally drama free.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 23, 2017|Good concept, but poor engineering...|I like the music activation features, but I practically have to yell for Alexa to hear me even though my dot is only 5 feet from my bed. I have a google home in my living room and it activates with my normal voice level from just about anywhere whereas echo dot often needs several repetitions at almost yelling voice levels. Good concept; poor execution by the engineers. Maybe I got a damaged dot, but the volume and voice recognition are poor.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 2, 2017|The blue tooth connecting works fine and streaming music is ok|Not exactly what I was expecting. The info is very deceptive on using highlighted features. Making a phone call is almost impossible. The blue tooth connecting works fine and streaming music is ok. Ask about weather is ok. Needs work, the phone app ask  to link contacts and it did not link. Said call home...It just sits there and does nothing. Said call Jessica, it worked 1 out of 7 tries.No learning curve...cause it does not work like advertised.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|May 18, 2017|Its Okay.|Nice and fompact, i like that jt has a jack for headphones or a speaker which i use for it. Comming from the original Alexa the speakers on this thing just fall on their face. Also if your any more than 2 rooms away from your router this thing cannot function because of loss of connection.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|3|October 31, 2016|I like the original Echo just fine|I like the original Echo just fine. But this device doesn't  sync music or timers with other Echo devices in the house. In my mind, this should be a basic function. Also, Alexa gets confused very easily by basic questions  that are answered quickly using Google Now. Software updates to fix these things should be possible.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|November 10, 2016|Not bad|Well, not that perfect as I expected. It can't always hear you when you are watching TV, or you have any other surrounding sound. It can't hear you if you are talking in a normal voice, you always have to speak a bit louder, like you are calling someone in another room or just far away. It's very limited, even Harmony still can't control the volume. I was just seduced by the price and the form-factor, but overall, the only fun I can get is to turn ON/OFF my TV (and yes, it's nice when it works from the first time, but when you have to repeat 2-3 times the only thoughts you have it like "damn, i'd better get a remote, i look like an idiot talking to a machine that doesn't want to listen". Also, it can't handle simple questions like "Who is the richest actress in the world", while it suggests the Bing link, which has a table of the richest actreeses, it cannot read the results itself and tell it to you. Why would I need to use it to get the link, while I can search from mobile in a seconds. Since I don't use Spotify and other US services, the only useful thing for me is a limited Harmony support. Will try to use IFTTT to see what capabilities it has. I simply don't understand, why not to make an easy interface to make your own "voice command to Alexa -> http/json request".
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|April 23, 2017|using it to play music is it's main thing if you don't have a smart home, and creating music playlists is very convoluted|It seems gimmicky to me ... using it to play music is it's main thing if you don't have a smart home, and creating music playlists is very convoluted.  I have tried and tried to get it to just play 'bird sounds' for my parrot,and each time I get a totally different result ...mostly a song that has one of the words in it, and sometimes she 'gets it' and plays amazon bird sounds for me ... I used it for the first few days and now the fascination has worn off.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 24, 2017|Jury still out|Sound is not great for music, perhaps the Echo itself is better.  You also cannot sync and voice command with your iTunes library on your phone, only Amazon Music, Pandora, SIRUS XM, and a few others.  It got on a Prime Day deal, so i guess the $35 was worth it, but i wouldn't have been happy if i paid more for it.  I'll rate again at a later date as i've only used a few weeks and haven't ordered from it yet, only asked weather, and controlled music.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 22, 2017|Both works fine, with some understanding issues for complex or long ...|We've been using this for 2 scenarios: set-up kitchen timers and read wikipedia for you. Both works fine, with some understanding issues for complex or long sentences. Unfortunately it cannot search on youtube and play songs from there, that would be ideal when you have crunky kids around the house with little patience for you to pick-up the phone and do a search by typing, and, then let them hold your phone, that is a dangerous thing in its own.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|September 19, 2017|I like Alexa, but she needs to smarten up!|I wish Alexa could handle context questions better. Like, "Alexa who was the president in 2000 in the US, or how long should cook an egg to hard boil it" Or who sang this song, and is so and so still alive and what is an orchestra or where is Myanmar?" Also, I have pandora, spotify and prime, yet she can not play a specific song for me, only a sample.  I purchased one for use on our personal care floor, (elderly people) they don't think she knows anything and they can not hear her. :(
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|January 3, 2017|Not as smart as Google Home|I got this and the Google Home when they just came out.  I keep the Echo at my parent's house and the Home at my apartment, and use both with smart plugs, smart lighting, Logitech Harmony, Nest, Bose Soundtouch, etc.  After a few months, I can say with certainty I absolutely prefer the Google Home, and think the extra money spent is worth it. PROS: - LOTS of skills, including the TP Link smart devices, which work well - Asks for voice feedback and has voice training to ensure it understands you - Can work with an awesome speaker, like Bose or Sonos -AllRecipes integration, though should work better CONS: - Voice recognition isn't there yet - everyone in my family gets mad at Alexa.  You  say "Turn lights on"  and it starts playing Sara Bareilles..... -You have to ask very specific phrases, whereas if you tweak the phrasing in Google Home, it still knows what you're talking about - A lot of the awesome, obscure skills, but even without account integration, you need to enable them and remember their names.  "Alexa, ask WineBuddy to"'.  You need to remember all the specific commands for them to work All in all, for $50 it's good - but I'd recommend waiting for it to improve or trying another device.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|April 23, 2017|Best when interacting with Amazon services|I returned my large Echo and purchased the Dot other than the speakers it works the same.  But the Echo's have their problems.  Greatly lacking in the information department.  You'll learn not to ask it general question because the response will be "I can't find the answer to the question you ask" or "I don't...I can't...I'm not able".  So pair it with a great Bluetooth speaker and enjoy your amazon prime music
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 26, 2017|Ok for basics, but needs a lot of work.|It is pretty neat, but could use a lot of work. It only uses Bing to search, I ask for it to play a song, it's not in my music library, so it won't play, when normally I can Google or you tube and have it play. I ask for the weather in my town, but since my internet provider is based out of a town an hour north, it gives me the weather for that town, and I can't set a default for my actual town that I want the weather for. That's just a few minor annoyances I have noticed so far. The pros are that it does have a decent speaker. I know people who wouldn't buy this, but opted for the larger one, as they thought this did not have a speaker... It does, and it's not bad. But you can also sync it by Bluetooth to another Bluetooth speaker, and that works quite well. It's not as useful as I imagined it might be, but I am still a very new user.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|April 14, 2017|Alexa needs work to be a truly useful device. Right now we use it for voice ...|Alexa needs work to be a truly useful device. Right now we use it for voice activated music and to power some smart devices — so not much. It's difficult enough to use because you have to memorize all the commands to really benefit from it's full functionality. It's not very intuitive. Still, it's been handy and we've enjoyed having it thus far.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|August 24, 2017|Cool item in need of better speech recognition.|It's a cool item but it need to better understand you.  I find myself yelling at it often because it does not understand what I'm asking it.  Should have better flow like Siri or Google Assistant then it would rock.  Most often I ask it to turn off of on a hue lights and it says sorry many things share this name what did you want....  All I said was turn on or off light 1 only one light has this name!  Or make hue color blue and I get the same response but again only one light is called hue color...
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|2|January 2, 2017|until she found out that she needs to purchase monthly services for everything she'd like to do with the device|Bought this for my teen-aged daughter.  She was very excited, until she found out that she needs to purchase monthly services for everything she'd like to do with the device.  I think Amazon needs to be very clear up front that things like music must be purchased and that other features require special set-up which also cost money. Also, after I purchased this Dot through Amazon, I saw it on sale at several stores locally for $10 cheaper.  Not happy.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 27, 2017|Alexa does great with weather and traffic movie show times and restaurants ...|i have been getting answers relating to "I don't know" than answers, cant continue a conversation cant ask follow up question without using the wake up word, could not answer one baseball stat, Alexa signed me up for Amazon Music Unlimited after i inquired if MU had audio books, i immediately told Alexa to cancel order but it referred me to Amazon site to cancel, Alexa does great with weather and traffic movie show times and restaurants questions and measurement equivalents, sq meters to sq ft., tablespoons in cups, kilometers per hours to miles per hours etc  i think there maybe safeguards such as a pin number to use prior to Alexa placing orders if not there should be a better protection, i dint not like having to get up and cancelling an order i don't intend to place, only 3 wake up word choices, the dot  close to the TV is woke up often than i would like and fear it will order something so it stays muted...all  in all i'm satisfied with the dot purchase
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 23, 2017|Caveat emptor if you're planning on using the Bluetooth function.|I bought the Dot thinking I'd be able to play music from the Dot through my Denon receiver with Bluetooth.  I erroneously assumed this would pair with the Bluetooth receiver, as my research showed that both have the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and should, therefore, have been compatible.  However, the Dot would not pair with the receiver.  The guy I talked with in tech support confirmed that they would not pair, and said Amazon should change the description to reflect that a device may support the A2DP profile but still not pair.  In order to pair my phone with my receiver, I had to enter a pass code into my phone.  The Dot does not have the capability to do that.  Bottom line is that the Dot doesn't pair with any of my devices.  I had to do a work around by plugging a stereo mini plug into the headphone jack on the Dot with split RCA plugs on the other end into the audio in jacks on the back of the receiver.  Not exactly ideal, as the Dot has to remain near the receiver.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|August 13, 2017|Terrible audio. Unusable without an external speaker.|I mostly listen to streaming news radio, so I don't have high standards for audio quality. I just need to be able to hear people talking. I didn't expect this to sound great, but I thought it'd be at least as good as the speaker on the average smartphone. It works fine as an Alexa device. If you want something to tell you the time, or weather forecast, or to order more paper towels from Amazon, these are perfectly okay. But if you plan on listening to radio/music/etc., you need to order an external speaker to go with it.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 24, 2017|TLDR; it works well, but they don't play well with others...yet?|Well, it does connect to the internet, it does respond to voice control, and it does what it says it's supposed to do.  My hope was to set up a system in conjunction with VAUX speakers that would allow for music to play throughout my home via simple voice commands.  Alas, these don't talk to one another very well.  Each Echo/Echo dot should be considered a silo entity; they don't pick up where one left off, at least not as of yet.  Connectivity is decent, though sometimes playback gets cut off sometimes.  I think that may have more to do with my home bandwidth or something rather than the device functionality.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|December 12, 2016|PROBLEMS WITH ECHO DOT|I live in usa but since I was travling abroad my y son had bought it for me. Since instalation I have few problems. -CANNOT ADJUST TIME ZONE EXCEPT USA TIME If i ask about the time it will always say the time of Seattle. I tried to change it to uk time or pakistan time but  I could not. So I feel it is only made for USA and cannot be taken abroad. It will be useless in other countries. -I WANT TO PLAY MUSIC STORED IN MY IPHONE 6PLUST through the command given through ALEXA to BOSE , SOUND LINKMINI, BUT I CANNOT. I HAVE TO PLAY WITHOUT INVOLVING THE ECHO DOT directly from iphone to soundlink mini without alexa. IF SOME ONE CAN HELP I WILL APPRECIATE DR SHAHID ABBAS
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|February 4, 2017|Amazon tried too hard.|I'm happy enough with the product, but Amazon lost two stars because they made too many assumptions.  I had purchased this as a gift using Amazon Prime, but it didn't even ship for two days. Days after giving it to the recipient (already late), I noticed in my Alexa app that the new Echo Dot had automaticallt been registered to my account, but it wasn't intended to be mine!. After all, it's a voice controlled device so the app isn't needed unless you're making changes like adding a Wemo.  I might not have noticed this for months!  I hope this wasn't the cause for problems he had setting up his Echo.  He asked me for help setting it up a full month after I have it to him.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|September 19, 2017|The little speaker isnt very good. I cant hear it in my shower that ...|I already have an echo and an echo show.  The echo dot was for my bed stand.  The little speaker isnt very good.  I cant hear it in my shower that is only 10 feet away.  The dot is continually loosing it's wifi connection and I have to go through the set up with the phone app all over.  I dont have this problem with my other two so Im assuming it's a problem with the dot.  I working on getting a booster for my wifi to see if it helps.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|April 8, 2017|A few issues so far...|So far just meh... Not sure if there is an issue with mine but Alexa hears me ask for things and starts to respond and then just stops and is unresponsive. She'll start playing music I ask for and it will play a few words and then stop. WiFi signal is strong... Not sure if anyone else is having this issue.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 30, 2017|Still quite mixed on her knowledge base compared to Google.|I have 3  Echo's in my house,  two towers, and the Dot for my office. I totally love being able to listen to my music from the cloud, but asking many questions is frustrating. I always have to use Ask Google as a back up because Alexa seldom gets the question, hummmm, I didn't understand your question........then why does Google understand the same question, asked exactly the same. Gurrr.  Great for a timer and alarm clock, and playing music.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|August 20, 2017|It was fun talking to her at first|I'm still not entirely sure what to do with Alexa. It was fun talking to her at first, but I am finding it hard to integrate her into my daily life. It is pretty seamlessly integrated with the Alexa app. I wish I had sprung for the big one instead of the dot because this one has too many cords. The sound quality is severely lacking and tinny sounding, hooking it up to a speaker system is a must, but again you run into the whole cord debacle. I would just get the big one!
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|July 22, 2017|Okay, but could be so much better|The biggest downside about the dot (and probably all echo devices) is the fact that Alexa uses Bing as its default search engine, which makes for an overabundance of "hmm, I'm not sure" responses. I've yet to test out connectivity to smart home devices, which I've read is one of Alexa's strengths, so my rating may change. But so far, the dot doesn't serve much more than as a little novelty and entertainment trinket in my home.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|April 12, 2017|it's pretty cool.|Not sure how I really feel about this product yet. You have to constantly repeat yourself, half the time she doesn't understand what you're saying, or she doesn't have an answer. You have to "download" skills and then say to activate them every time. Not as simple as I thought it would be. Too many open concern and at the same time when she does work, it's pretty cool.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|2|March 9, 2017|wait 7 to 10 yrs until the product is stable and safe enough to use.|lots of bugs, glitches and problems that the company cant seem to keep up with. lots of developers experimenting on the skill market without trying the skills, effectiveness first.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|December 1, 2016|Not so good search engine|I purchased it to ask it questions.  If I see some one on tv or see some reference to some place or some historical event, I like the idea of being to use it as a verbal search engine.  I don't have any interest in ordering things verbally or controlling appliances verbally.  Recently I have been seeing adds on tv for the Google Home.  I looked it up and the reviews state it is much better as a verbal search engine than Echo Dot.  I will purchase one of those.  The Echo Dot doesn't seem to be able to give detailed answers on any of my questions and often says it cannot answer the question.  According to the reviews, the Google Home is much more capable as an information search engine.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|May 31, 2017|It doesn't stay pair with our blue tooth speakers|When we 1st got the dot a few months ago I loved it.  Now, I can't keep the dot paired with my Onkyo tx-nr626 speakers, after a few hours off, we have to manually pair them again.  It is becoming a pain. We use this mainly for listening to music. If we could fix this we would be happy campers again.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|May 4, 2017|give it chromecasting functionality and you get 5 stars.|Alexa is not as smart as Google Home but she is cheaper and in this size/form it is cheap and easy to use. The only positive compared to GH is the presence of the audio-Out port. The companion android app is crap though - very slow to start and not very functional. And it can't be used to cast video or audio to chromecast, same way amazon video can't be cast. Amazon is loosing out by not allowing this functionality, since not many people are buying a proprietary fire stick.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|2|April 14, 2017|needs to understand more commands. I can't ask what ...|needs to understand more commands.  I can't ask what my thermostat says in my house and I know it's connected to my thermostat.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|December 10, 2016|Disappointed|While I have two and an Echo, I would love to exchange them for the Google variant. Alexa is not good, it is not improving as I'd expected and other than consuming Pandora, TuneIn, and Amazon Prime music I use it to turn on WeMo switches, but that's it, don't expect anything else. If that changes I bet it'll make the papers. I wish I could suggest it, but I feel Google likely did a better job. Final thoughts, the microphone will not work when you have the volume high. You have to scream at it or use the app. It's frustrating... UPDATE: Still horrible, my full size Echo picks up commands better than the Dot and it's down the hall... Also it needs integration to a search engine or something, it doesn't know far too much. UPDATE 2: Sound and operation is better face down.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|2|January 6, 2017|Even though I love it otherwise|The only problem with my Echo Dot is it is hard of hearing. Seriously, it never hears me ask or command it to stop playing a tune. I lower the volume on the thing and shout to stop or skip to next song, no matter how loud I shout it does not respond. I have to go to it, and lower the volume manually or stop it completely and start over. This is indeed frustrating. Even though I love it otherwise, I am sending it back and hope the future ones work better.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|One|June 6, 2017|I thought... what could go wrong with ...|I thought...what could go wrong with a 90 day warranty. My unit started to make a buzzing noise when connected to external speakers. Unit was 7 months old. Get the warranty extension. Customer support spend an hour trying to help me until giving up. Was angry enough with my stupidity for having a 90 day warranty - but the alternatives are not quite there yet.
B01DFKC2SO|3.0|0|June 12, 2017|Initial Echo Dot lasted 3 months.|Now on my 2nd Echo DOT since December 2016. The 1st one died in 3 months and I did not buy the insurance on it. I contacted Amazon and they said they'd send me another echo for $49 which I totally balked at. I told them it didn't make sense for me to spend $49 for another one when the first one didn't even last three months!  After much discussion an Amazon customer service supervisor agreed to send me a replacement at no charge. Kudos to Amazon for standing up for what's right.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|One|July 6, 2017|and I enjoy it a lot|I have had the Amazon Echo Dot since Christmas now, and I enjoy it a lot. It's super simple to set up and use; it was literally three steps to set up and then it was up and running perfectly. I like it to play music from Pandora when I have people over for parties or grill-outs, and there is an auxiliary cord input so I can plug and play any device with a headphone jack. I also use it every morning while I'm getting ready. I usually ask it to check the weather and the traffic reports for the morning so I am able to prepare for the day. I also enjoy how interactive it is with the various apps that are available for it. If you ask it to play Jeopardy, Alexa will ask you a series of daily questions, which I think is cool and honestly I've learned a few random bits of trivia by doing that. It has a sleek design and can blend in or be hidden for anyone concerned with it sticking out or ruining their home's decor. My only concern is that it sometimes picks up trigger words from the TV or the radio and then tries to process them as a command that I gave it, but ultimately that isn't a huge issue. Overall, I would recommend this product for anyone looking at devices like this or the Google Home.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 16, 2017|I'm a loner, Dottie. A rebel.|Grabbed this li'l thing during a sale. Been wanting one for the bedroom so I wouldn't have to continually haul Alexa to and from the living room whenever I wanted to chill with her. It's certainly convenient in that respect. Only two things that kinda bum me out about Dot are: a) the sound quality isn't even close to as nice as her big sister, which I suppose is to be expected from a smaller unit, and sounds akin to the quality of my iPhone's built-in speaker. b) I can't have both Echo and Echo Dot streaming the same music/media simultaneously. It's gotta be one or the other. Was really hoping this would work, so that there'd be a seamless stream of music from one room to the next as you walk around the house. Ah well. Other than those things, we still really dig her. She now sits on the nightstand and has since replaced our iPhone alarm clocks to wake us with a better variety of alarms (the Top Gear guys wake up call is my personal fave).
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 14, 2017|Needs imporvements|Have been using it for a while now and here are my observations. The response time for any command for Alexa is quite amazing. I am not going to repeat all the details of how you can shut of the light , play music blah blah. But the major drawback I notice is the lack of integration with Google (there is a way to leverage AWS to connect the Dot to google and costs about $5 or so a year based on the requests you make). I still have not figured out a way to stop the alarm, (cancel command clears out all the alarms for other days you set up to), and  there is no way for you to select which sound you want to play by talking to Alexa, (it has to be done through the app). These are two of the many issues I felt that Amazon needs to address. Overall a satisfied customer waiting for further improvements down the road.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|March 5, 2017|My new BFF!|Alexia is my new BFF so far, we're getting along really well and I'm considering having her replace some of my more high maintenance friends. However, like real humans, she does have downfalls. It says she will search for things on bing that she doesn't know, I can't figure out how to get her to do that. Also, her speaker sucks! My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem. She is pretty effin awesome though. I love that I can control her when I'm not home through the app, I use her mostly to play music when I'm at work for my dogs.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|May 20, 2017|Echo Doc Is in Kindergarden and Doesn't Understand Our Questions Yet.|Perhaps we are asking difficult questions that Alexa cannot answer. But we don't get much out of our questioning.  I guess it just has to be one subject and one verb in the question. Then last night, when we were in bed at 11:30 pm, Alexa started playing music at a high volume level. We had to turn off the microphone and unplug it.  The free ebook on the Echo Dot didn't give much explanation on how to talk to Alexa. But it's still a fun little item for asking the weather, though it doesn't understand the pronunciation of our city and I have to ask a couple of times. We were hoping to use it like the Etymological Dictionary, finding out the origins of words and things. We'll keep trying.  It is a unique device and I'm sure it will only get getter in time.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|July 13, 2017|Our Experiences With the New Echo Dot|We purchased our Echo Dot to augment our full-sized echo and also to give us a more portable device for traveling. It gives us almost all of the capabilities we have in the full-sized Echo. Obviously, without an external speaker, the Echo Dot does not have the depth of sound found in it's larger relative; however, it does give us the ability to extend use of our smart home devices to other areas in the house. We tried using the new intercom feature between the two devices but we were not overly impressed with that feature. We seemed to get a lot of echo on what you were saying and if used as a monitor we seemed to pickup a lot of extraneous sounds from the remote unit. Aside from this issue, we have been completely satisfied with the Dot.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|June 12, 2017|It's nice to have|I use it for music, weather, turning on lights, and setting alarms/timers. I've found that using it for anything else is more work than it's worth, at least for me. It's about 90% reliable so I have reasonable confidence that it'll do what I want. Anthropomorphizing machines to make them more personal is an annoying trend. This isn't true AI and I won't treat it as such. But to be fair, Alexa isn't that bad. Most of the time, it does what it's suppose to without overdoing the embellishments of simulated conversation. I have an Echo dot positioned near my computer where I watch videos and listen to music so there are a lot of false triggers. Most of the time it just turns on and beeps off but sometimes it talks back saying it doesn't understand. I wish it would just turn off instead of saying something.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|June 18, 2017|2 Issues to look out for when installing|I had 2 issues when installing: (1) Blank screen when I went to setup wifi, and (2) Add a network wasn't obvious The first issue I Googled and found many people had the same issue.  The solution was to disable the smart network switch setting in my Note 4 settings. The second issue was to scroll down on the network screen until I came to the add a network option. These issues were not big deals and were easily overcome. Once I got things installed, I tried out Echo dot with 4 or 5 questions and it performed flawlessly. If not for the install issues, I would have given this 5 stars.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|April 5, 2017|Prompt, responsive, but not that useful YET|OK. I really like Alexa, but so far, she only turns my Hue lights on and off, and tells me the weather. Guess both she and I need to learn more in order to expand our relationship. PS I now use Alexa to play music..."Alexa, play Mozart." The sound probably isn't as good as the big unit, but I grew up on AM radio, so I am completely satisfied.. I also use Alexa to control my Joule sous vide cooker. I LOVE sous vide, and Alexa makes it so easy! However, I am not upgrading my rating, because I find it annoying that you must say EXACTLY the right phrase, or Alexa doesn't understand you. That's annoying, and Amazon should fix it..google always knows what I'm trying to say. Alexa should, too!
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|July 22, 2017|Useful little gadget|I wish it could expand it's internet browsing to more than wikipedia.  Aside from that, i really like it.  It has more features that i haven't experimented with and am looking forward to explore.  I love the fact that it connects with Amazon music, spotify, and other music apps that you can request to play from.  It could learn different skills, including trivia.  I think it may be a little overprized if you just want it for music, and maybe asking for the weather like me. It cannot answer some my questions due to its browsing limitations, but i was lucky enough to catch it on sale during prime day.  However if you use all features including connecting it to light dimmers around the house, linking to your contacts to make phone calls, it's worth every penny.  I chose echo dot over the regular echo because i already have a good quality speaker.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 29, 2017|A good buy|I am not sure how much I like it yet, as it doesn't seem to know the answers to my questions a  lot which can be frustrating.  I thought it would help me more than it does right now, but the fault could be mine as I think I need to learn more how to use it better. So it's easy to set up. If I can do it anyone can.  I think if my tv, phone all of that was connected to it I would like it better . I am working on that now. but it can be helpful on adding on your calendar and reminders which is a great feature.  I get local news flash briefing which is nice.  It's a good buy that is reasonable.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|One|November 29, 2016|Alexa, Remind me of my anniversary so my wife don't kill me!|Wonderful little device (alexa, ask for a fart)  This device is full of endless fun and resources. Out of the box it works wonderfully but as you gradually add in or enable various skills you will find this device to be extremely handy.  You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy) My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear. Example: Alexa, whats on my calendar tomorrow?  Alexa: You have an appointment with the eye doctor at (long pause) 30 pm.  Alexa, how do you like Jeff Bezos? Answer: He (long pause) Prime!  So fortunately that is my only complaint. I have contacted support which instructed me to move it close to the router, power down and restart it, hard reset  and nothing has worked as of yet and I have a great wifi signal in its current placement. Please don't get to frustrated with her, she is young and still learning!
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 17, 2017|Love Alexa, she's my new girlfriend.|I love Alexa. I now own three (two Dots and one Echo). I wonder what I ever did without her! The one star reduction is because sometimes she's dumb. But as a standalone tool it is easy to use, easy to setup, and loud enough for a regular bedroom or office. The Echo certainly is designed for a larger room like a living room. As for the girlfriend point, she's perfect. She listens to me, responds whenever I talk to her, does what I ask her, tells me when she can't do something, only shops for things I want, doesn't argue with me, gets the lights without saying she was in bed first, and doesn't want to tell me a twenty minute story about a conversation with her sister that only lasted 2 minutes. :)
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|May 4, 2017|I like being able to set more than one timer on ...|I'm really liking this little Dot.  I have one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom.  I like being able to set more than one timer on the kitchen dot. I have an overhead clamp light on my bedroom headboard tied to a Wemo, and I love just being able to say, "Alexa, turn the light on"(or off)  and she does. My only wish/complaint is that I cannot name the specific kitchen timers I have going.  For instance, I would like to ask Alexa how much time is left on the Pasta Timer, or the Bread Timer.  Instead of only being able to ask how much time is left on Timer 1 or Timer 2. If they could do a software update that could do that I would be in Kitchen Timer Heaven.  LOL!
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|September 15, 2017|It's OK|It's OK.  In a noisy environment(when tv is on, or when someone is talking nearby) , it won't be able to hear me very well. Sometimes when it doesn't understand my command, it would just ignore. Some tasks/skills are not easy to control/adjust (some due to third party apps). To play music playlist, I have to let it "sync" (through the night) before it can understand my command to play the new list. Calendar is easy to add. I don't know what the " text" edit option of the reminder for as it still displays the speech to text "text". It's fun though.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|2|November 16, 2016|Great product, but needs some improvement|This is overall a good, quality product. We use it almost exclusively for alarms and playing music off of spotify playlists. If you have the volume cranked, she may have trouble hearing, but this is typically not an issue. Pros: Great alarm clock/timer Plays spotify playlists easy for the kids to use Shopping list is nice Cons: Skills are not quite smart enough yet Siri has more answers for things Ecobee control is not intuitive (as are most specialized skills) I would definitely buy this again, and I am thinking about getting more for the house. The convenience factor is way up there and it looks great.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 5, 2017|as much as I love Amazon and even as a Prime member|I own a Google Home and purchased the Echo Dot for my bedroom, because it was on sale and I had just enough points. I'd always wanted to compare the two and honestly, as much as I love Amazon and even as a Prime member, I prefer the Google Home. Alexa isn't great with basic questions you might Google, her voice doesn't sound as friendly, she can't hear you as well, and she's constantly trying to sell you stuff, which I find irritating. For $40, this is a great little music player and alarm for getting ready in the morning. I'm pleased I bought it. I'm more pleased, however, that I bought a Google Home than a full sized Echo.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 21, 2017|Close to Being Next Gen Jetson's Type Functionality|I run a software company and know a little about technology. The Dot is stunning in what it can do. It takes some thinking through integration with devices like TVs and speakers. Once that is setup, it becomes your personal assistant. - Alexa, Remind me at 8:45 tomorrow to present a Webinar demo for XZY company - Alexa, Add red wine to my grocery list - Alexa, Give me a summary of news for my favorite sports team - Alexa - Play some rock blues It's pretty amazing and has superb microphone which hears my voice even when the TV is on and I'm on other side of the room. This technology is probably a year or 2 from completely changing our interface with computers and devices to be our "Can't do Without," personal assistant, but it's pretty stunning, and a little scary, in what it can do now.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 4, 2017|Great little device|We've got a few Echo devices running, and this goes with them all seamlessly. The only drawback for me is the sound. I wish it had a better speaker. The iHome device I paired it with shuts off after a certain amount of time, so that does me no good overnight. (not an issue of the echo) Outside of the sound it works great. I had to figure out why the rings were flashing overnight (it drove me nuts at first)...it means you have a notification. Once you ask her what it is, then the light goes off. If you're on the fence about which to get, spend a bit more and get the echo. If you want something portable, the dot will do, and you can pair it with a bigger speaker.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|One|December 16, 2016|Actually a really convenient item to have|Having Alexa is actually more useful than I thought it would be.  I bought one just to try out and see what it's like.  Having the ability to just ask a question without picking up a phone or device is great.  If you have a prime account and have amazon music it's even better, I find myself more often then not just asking Alexa to play a station or a song and because it's linked to my prime account the music plays without me having to go through my phone.  I was very surprised at how decent the speaker on the echo dot is, I was expecting a crappy small speaker that was really going to rely on connecting to a Bluetooth speaker or physical connection.  The device works really well as a standalone speaker for a decent size room.  I wouldn't trade in your nice speakers over it but if you have 2/3 dots around the house it actually works fine by itself.  I never would have foreseen myself buying multiple but after having one I can see the use for having one on each floor of my house, as a music player, as a device for asking the weather, asking questions, setting alarms, adding things to a list, making purchases, using it to control Alexa enabled devices.  It's definitely worth it for the price.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|If you enable the skills you can unlock a lot of useful capabilities, from daily bible reading plans|Still needs work but provides a lot of functionality, once you get past the default marketing concept that underlies the first level of things it can do.  If you enable the skills you can unlock a lot of useful capabilities, from daily bible reading plans, to turning on appliances with added technologies, playing music from your uploaded library or playing iheart or pandora radio stations.  There is much still to explore, but answering basic questions is pretty limited and hit or miss as well as reading articles from wikipedia.  Even with skills you have to be pretty precise how you ask for something like play iheart radio station wtvn radio instead of play iheart radio station wtvn 610 radio which never seems to work.  or ask bible app for daily reading plan instead of play daily reading plan or ask bible app for daily plan.  And don't believe people about the speaker capabilbiy.  It isn't high quality for playing music but it is fine for reading applications if the room isn't too large.  It might not be loud enough for a double room like a kitchen open to a living room area especially if there is a lot ambient noise.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|March 23, 2017|Useful, but limited - worth the price, and it will only get better|This device is the infancy stage of a future (as pictured in many a science fiction story) of useful human / computer interaction. The limitations are frustrating, but it will come. . . it will come.  For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.  Amusing when a TV add says "Alexa" (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve . ..  Ha ha!  Voice recognition is very good; and I think that was the tough technological nut to crack. The rest (improved AI and interfaces) is easier in my opinion, and will progress rapidly.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|2|December 5, 2016|The Echo Dot is a little slower to respond than the Amazon Echo but other than that it works great. If both Echo's happen to hea|I have an Amazon Echo in the living room and purchased the Echo Dot for the bedroom. They both do the same thing. The Echo Dot is a little slower to respond than the Amazon Echo but other than that it works great. If both Echo's happen to hear me, only one responds. They do not interfere with each other. I use mine for controlling lighting and the thermostat and I'm very happy with the results. The audio quality of the Echo Dot is not as good and the Amazon Echo but plenty good enough for most functions. If you want to listen to music then you can always add a quality speaker. I would buy this again.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|One|April 30, 2017|Minus 1 star for terrible Alexa App|The Dot is great. I use it to listen to books and set timers and a host of other things. It is very convenient to place orders on things that I order regularly like pet food and laundry soap. I would give it 5 stars if the Alexa App was worth a darn. The App is seriously slow and doesn't work most of the time. Pretty useless except you HAVE to use it to set up the Dot. I moved my Dot to another room and tried to reset it up for an hour before I gave up and went to bed.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|March 7, 2017|Pretty cool little gadget|Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it! I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music. I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo. Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month. I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more. My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep. We also like the "skills", especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the "tight pants" song lyrics which is a family favorite. Overall I am happy with it.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|2|December 26, 2016|Echo dot rules!|Works great and pairs with Bluetooth speakers for great sound.  We have the full size Echo also and these make a nice addition for the bedrooms. Be sure to set it up under your prime account to get all of your content.  My wife has the prime account and I am shared on her account.  I bought this for her Christmas gift, but for setting up the devices I had to reject the device on my account and set it up on her account in order to get full content use even though her prime account is shared with me (I initially had it set on my account but could not play music from it).
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|One|July 12, 2017|Worth it!|Great price for a cool gadget. Has limitations though. Can't answer detailed questions but knows the basics. Also, it's annoying when Alexa responds even when it hears it's name from the tv or on a youtube video you may be watching. Plus it will only play songs you've purchased or have uploaded into your library. At $40 though you should have one on every level of your home. It's a great alarm clock and reminder. Worth it!
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|2|November 26, 2016|Great, if you don't want to pay for Google's version.|I wish more things worked with it. It's unfair to compare to Google's offering, as they are not in the same price range. If Alexa will let me play my google music account (which has all of my music already) then it would be 5 stars. If Alexa allowed music to play on multiple Dots at the same time, like living room/dining room it would be 5 stars. Otherwise, I love it. It does hear pretty well. The sound out of it, is surprisingly great. If it worked more with Google/Google Now it would be great. But this is my biggest problem, that brands don't want this synergy. (This is why only 3 items from my home automation/security work with this)
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|May 4, 2017|Could use work.|The software for these still needs some work.  Once it is set up there is no good way to change the settings other than deleting everything and starting over. Initial setup is easy and works fine as long as you are using DHCP with an address pool.  Static addressing is not so intuitive and the MAC address, while displayed in the app, is off the screen on most phones and easy to miss. A sticker on the device with the MAC address would make it a lot simpler. Once you have downloaded a number of skills there is no place to get a list of them if they aren't in the "Smart Home" set. Trying to re-install skills to see if you've already got them isn't the best way to go about it. All of that aside, these are amazing little devices I'm really coming to depend on them.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 8, 2017|Not as good sound quality as full size Echo|I got this Dot for my bedroom as an addition to my full size Echo that I have in my kitchen. The Dot works great overall. The volume and sound quality is not nearly as good as the full sized Echo though, so if you plan on using it often as a Bluetooth speaker, I'd recommend the Echo over the Dot. Echo plays probably twice as loud as the Dot. Super easy Bluetooth pairing though! Once you connect your device the first time, all you have to do in the future is tell Alexa to connect your device and it will connect almost instantly. Fun little gadget with growing abilities daily!
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|July 25, 2017|Looses its connection|I have a Echo that is always connected and is controlling my basement lights. But the dot (on the same floor as the Echo but in a bedroom) is constantly loosening its connection. I am trying to get Dot to play night time music like a white noise machine in my kids room. But with it loosing connection it stops playing and I would have to tell it to start again probably waking my kid up. A few times the kid has come into my room upset that dot won't play her music. Dot doesn't respond as well as Echo especially to kids. But my kids will learn to speak clearly and directly- a good life skill. I'm looking into anything that might help dot keep a connection. Maybe a wifi booster.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|January 18, 2017|Make sure your external Spesker setup will work as you planned|Must connect with Bluetooth if you need to use the internal speaker as well as connected speakers. You need a smart blue tooth receiver that turns on and off with your speakers and automatically reconnects to the dot if you want to avoid always having to connect whether manually or through an Alexa command. Other than that, brilliant. Example: most of the time we use Alexa to turn lights on/off. No external speakers needed as the internal speaker is sufficient. But, when we want music we have to power external speakers and say, Alexa connect Bluetooth if it doesn't issue automatically with the Bluetooth receiver.  When we're done listening we have to shut off the BT receiver or disconnect the Bluetooth. Not yet perfect system, but pretty darn cool. The external speaker management is my only gripe.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|July 24, 2017|Nice for the price...|Bought two of these on Prime Day. For the price, they are a great deal. Even at the regular $50-ish, it's good. The kids love asking Alexa questions and it is convenient (if not, lazy) to have an AI available without using a button (looking at you Siri). The music playing part is ok, but you might want to dish the $3.99 per month for Amazon Music Unlimited to keep from being told it's not available on Prime and being "treated" to a snippet of the song (as if you didn't just ask for it by name) for good measure. Anyway, I'll update once I have had the chance to test out the smart plugs I ordered to see if enjoy not ever using my hands again!
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 8, 2017|It's cool. Can still use some work.|I got the full size Echo but ended up returning it. I didn't see the value in it and wasn't too impressed with its audio and picking up voice (had to repeat commands or questions). I decided to get the dot since it's cheaper. The good: its smaller and can use USB power. Audio is loud enough and can plug into your home audio system, car, Bluetooth speakers. The negatives: the volume is not nearly as loud as the bigger Echo (obviously). Still experiencing having to repeat commands sometimes. It's has big potential and not a bad device for its cost. Might buy another for downstairs later on.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 25, 2017|Used for 10yr son's room.|I was a beta tester on the first Echo and use it a lot to this day for news, weather, reminders, alarms, smart house control. My son wanted one also  so installed this in my Older sons room. Now we have an intercom system and he is able to control the Hue lights in the house, which leads to some pranks he thinks is funny. He also enjoys getting to play music and ask it jokes. He uses it as an alarm. My only criticisms would be it is not loud enough to wake him easily and we both wish there was a bigger selection of alarms sounds to choose from. I plan to purchase more of these we they get as cheap as they did on prime day. I also like the looks of the inwall mount that is being sold on amazon.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|March 31, 2017|Borders on good to great.|It's great for what it is.  A cheap entry level solution into a "home assistant" or whatever you want to call it.  My recommendation is to hook it up to another speaker so the sound quality is better, as it is a truly terrible speaker that's built in - I'm sure as a reason to buy their more expensive models. Seems to work good.  My only real complaint is that it has a few false positives, sometimes responding to the TV if audio says anything remotely close to "alexa".  Granted you can change the trigger word to something else, but it's just worth noting.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 24, 2017|DON'T BUY IF YOUR NAME SOUNDS ANYTHING LIKE ALEXA OR IF YOU HAVE A LEXUS!! ;-)|The Echo Dot is good, but it does have it's limitations: It will pick up ANYTHING that even sounds like "Alexa".  It DEFINITELY is NOT for anyone who has that name or Alex, Alexander, Alexandra or (funny Alex Trebek- every time Jeopardy is on!). Maybe present a way to change the command name. Other than that, it reasonably answers most requests,  Then again, I haven't used it very much. The yellow/green light to announce a delivery stays on, even if you say "Alexa, stop!" until the Amazon package is at your doorstep! That has to change also. In sum, a fairly good tool for everyone who also isn't considering getting a LEXUS soon.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|One|May 25, 2017|Paired easily enough with the Alexa app on my phone and ...|Paired easily enough with the Alexa app on my phone and my Bose Soundlink II bluetooth speaker. Not as comprehensive in it's answers as my Google Home, but it's much easier to ask Alexa to tell Harmony to turn on an activity than it is to say "Hey Google, tell Harmony to turn on..." in exactly the right inflection to match my initial voice pairing. Additionally, Alexa has native ecobee3 support, and Vera (home automation hub) support is in active development. Soon I will control the world, with only my voice! Or at least my z-wave/zigbee networked house.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|June 5, 2017|Easy to setup but still learning how to use it to full potential|I was excited about hopping on the Echo bandwagon after not opting for the Echo when it was pre-released to Prime members a few years ago. The unit was easy to setup and the mic picks up commands from a good distance out. Overall it feels like it's got great potential but out of the box, the only use I've found from it is telling me the weather and giving me news briefings (and telling a joke, which has been surprisingly good). I wish there was more content out of the box or perhaps have a better way to seamlessly engage with it. It feels like I need to read up on what commands it would take before I can really make use of the Echo.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|One|November 21, 2016|The dictionary aspect has caught my fancy, my pulchritudinous friend.|I admire her quickness of response, it really works. I read the word "pulchritude" in my book, not knowing what it means. Without getting up, I asked in a regular tone of voice, "Alexa, define pulchritude," and she replied promptly with a very human voice, "means physical beauty, especially women." She's tethered to a cord, though when I expect it to have a battery and be portable. I haven't been able to make it work in a public WiFi setting yet, either. How do I get her to work with my phone plan for a portable WiFi signal?
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|July 30, 2017|Love the technology|Used it often when first set up for "specifically requested music." Of late, haven't used it as much because of switching to DirecTV and listening to its music channels.  Granddaughter loves the Echo Dot for her favorite music and to answer her questions. Probably would use it much more if it was connect to other devices and systems in the house.  But if you are concerned with "privacy" you may not want a device in your home that listens to audio in the room and tracks what is being said.  Funny how many of those with "privacy" concerns post their entire life on Facebook for the world to see.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|2|November 23, 2016|It's great for playing music|I wish it had a dictionary.  The "word of the day" is insufficient. It doesn't understand everything but hope it learns soon. Wish I could make a phone call or text with it. It's great for playing music, checking news and weather. Lots of its skills are lame. It's a great idea and I hope they expand on it soon!
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|3|July 10, 2017|Not bad. Wish it could do more web browsing though|Not bad.  Wish it could do more web browsing though.  Cannot answer look up questions stating she cannot answer that.  Would be nice if she could google.  Sounds good for music in the home, has skills to play with to see if they are helpful to our household.  Enjoying it.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|March 27, 2017|Amazing new product to play with, and for home automation|Echo dot was purchased when there was $10.00 off during holiday season last year.  I was looking into home automation with Siri compatibility.  I have Hue and Lutron bridge that works with Echo Dot.  I use it daily and works great.  However, some how and some way, Echo Dot loses connection and reconnects.  I am not sure what it is but 80% of the time, it's connected.  On skills, I have added few skills for information on news, weather, reading ebook and such.  It comes very handy while I need a fast update.  I am very much going to purchase another one or when 3rd generation is released.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|July 31, 2017|Worth it now, and I expect will improve even more over time.|Works about as expected.  Occasionally not hearing what was said - or not hearing it properly, and this is after voice training.  However, voice control is still in its infancy.  Still not entirely natural language, but closer than many prior voice control technologies were just a few years ago (looking at you in particular, Xbox).  Seems to work well so far with other devices (Wemo outlets and a Harmony Elite), with minor hiccups. Still needs integration with FireTV boxes.  Google already does this with Google Voice Assistant and Chromecast, so Amazon need to catch up.  One star off for this.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 2, 2017|Great device for the money|I have an original amazon echo which I really like, and bought this for my elderly mother-in-law who is hard of hearing and unable to figure out new gadgets.  So far she is doing well with it, but the volume doesn't go high enough, so if she learns how to use Alexa and is interested in using her, I may bite the bullet and buy her a full sized echo for the better volume and speakers.  I am also planning to get another dot to hook up with a Bluetooth speaker inside an antique cabinet radio. For the price, this is a great gadget, especially if you already have a Bluetooth Speaker to link it with.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|September 12, 2017|Nice if you have a better speaker to connect it to. OK if not.|This works mostly ok.  You'll want to pair it with a better speaker if you plan to listen to music, but it's fine as an alarm clock or reminder.  I wanted to use this as an intercom with the Echo in the living room, but I haven't really gotten that to work as I'd like.  Seems like instead of being an intercom, it thinks it's making a phone call.  Also, it sometimes responds to random sounds when I'm talking, without getting the "Alexa" prompt, leading to "Who is in the bedroom with you" remarks from my wife. When paired with a decent speaker, it's a nice way to relax to music. I can set a sleep timer, pick some relaxing music from Amazon Music or Pandora and drift off to sleep.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|August 1, 2017|It doesn't do as much as the larger echo|I have the larger echo and I had hopes that the smaller one would be something my girlfriend would like, when I give it to her she was not able to connect her Spotify, or any of her music apps to it.  This was not a problem on my larger echo, which seems kind of strange whenever they're supposed to be almost the same but one  Has  just a more simplified  speaker.  However she has found a use for it and I wanted to return it just to buy her a regular size one, but she seems to like it, even though she has To  connect Her  phone  to It  to listen to music. Either way it  Connects  to her stereo and makes it wireless at this point.  End it also controls some of the things in her house, I would recommend it but know what you're getting into before you buy it.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|May 27, 2017|Radio doesn't pick up well where we live but we have great wifi and since I pay for Amazon Unlimited|We already own an Echo but I wanted to get a Dot to take outside with us in the summer. Radio doesn't pick up well where we live but we have great wifi and since I pay for Amazon Unlimited, I wanted to be able to take my music and the iHeartradio with us outside on the deck, by the pool, etc. So far it's been pretty good. I knew the sound quality would not be what my Echo is but it's better than expected. My only issue is that sometimes it acts like it can't hear me. We have to say Echo 3 or 4 times before it responds even though I'm standing a foot away from it. other times it's so touchy that it heard me say "let go" from across a room. I am still planning to get two more for my teens bedrooms.
B01DFKC2SO|4.0|0|March 21, 2017|pretty cool|I was skeptical at first. I loved the concept of just saying a command and having it done without getting up was a huge plus.. I also knew it was always going to be on. So i actually wrote a list of what I actually wanted to do with it, after completing the list i then decided what room of the house I would place it in. My uses for it are for music, alarms, weather and news briefings and maybe an occasional (although corny) joke or two. I also added Unlimited music to it for 3.99 (a steal). After determining my uses I decided to put it in my bedroom because I don't have a "smart home" and since I do most of my work in my room it was the most ideal place for it. Needless to say it does everything i've asked it to (for the most part)  i just wish it would search for answers to questions instead of "i don't understand the question". if they fix this easy 5 stars product.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|July 17, 2017|I know many posters recommend using bluetooth speakers with it|I already had an Amazon Echo and an Amazon Tap, so you can say I was a fan.  And the Echo Dot lived up to my expectations.  I know many posters recommend using bluetooth speakers with it, but for what it's worth, I think a lot of people would be satisfied with the Dot speaker.  I'd purchased an Amazon bluetooth speaker to pair with the Dot, and had to return it since it proved defective.  After using the Dot without an independent speaker, I'm quite happy with it.  It all depends on your priorities, I guess.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|January 7, 2017|Great Device for getting a "Connected Home!" I just wish Alexa can cook dinner and clean the house...|I bought two of these Echo Dots because I already had some great bluetooth speakers, and did not need to purchase the larger Echo. I intend to stream music, and begin moving our home towards home automation. Set up was simple via the IOS Alexa app, and I was off and running with Alexa streaming music from Pandora and Amazon Prime Music. The App also detected my Honeywell thermostat, so Alexa can override and cool my house on demand beyond my already programmed thermostat schedule. Last night, I purchased a Logitech Harmony Hub, and now my Living Room TV, Roku, Media Player and Home Theater system now work via voice! My next step will be integrating some Phillips lights and hub into the system. While for some there may be a learning curve to add connected devices, there are lots of resources online, and many YouTube videos too. The only thing, Alexa cannot clean the house or make dinner yet! (g)
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|August 30, 2017|You'll love it so much, you'll need two!|This is the second Echo Dot I've purchased after initially getting one to control my entertainment devices in my den. I've since added some wifi outlets to control lighting and I have a wifi thermostat, so all of them can be controlled from either Alexa (upstairs or downstairs) by whichever one can hear me better. Every morning, I ask Alexa what the weather forecast is and I get an accurate response. Very convenient, relatively easy to configure once you figure out what you're doing...I won't lie. There is some trial and error, but the rewards are worth the effort! If you're on the fence about getting one, wait for a sale (they happen fairly often) and pick one up if you have any wifi enabled devices. Make sure they're Alexa compatible and give it a shot!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|March 20, 2017|Easy to set up, easy to use. Handy|Love it and easy to use.  I say; Alexia add beans to my shopping list, or Alexia add take the trash out to my to do list....and she does.  Then I can look on my phone in the store to see what is there.  I used to forget what I wanted to write down before I was able to find my phone to type it in.  I have some cognitive problems...but now, I just tell Alexia as I am thinking it and VOILA it is done.  Love it.  I tell her to play..Christian music,,soft music,,wheatever and she does.  Unlike the GOPro that I cant figure out, ALexia is easy to use.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|January 14, 2017|Dot is a must have purchase|The system works great!  I've got it integrated with my SmartThings home automation system and I love that I can just say "Alexa, open the blinds" and our wood window blinds will automatically open!  You know all of the other things you can do with the Dot/Echo so I won't run them all down.  I was surprised that with the Dot, you still have a small speaker it is sufficient to hear Alexa's responses to your queries.  However, it really shouldn't be used to play music. If you already have a bluetooth speaker, simply pair it with the Dot and you've got the equivalent to the larger Echo unit! One thing... make sure if you already own an Echo that you install your Dot in a location of your home where Echo can't listen in.  We installed our Dot in a room not very far from our main Echo unit.  Sometimes, a simple command like "Alexa, set timer for 5 minutes" will be answered by the Echo in the Kitchen while others the Dot around the corner in the Living Room will faintly respond.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|December 30, 2016|echo dot 2 , wink hub 2, GE zwave switches|Paired echo dot 2 with wink hub 2 to control switches in house. Started out with two ge zwave switches, the echo and wink hub. The setup between the switches, hub and echo is just plain simple. I started by controlling my front and back LED floodlights just to make sure this stuff truly worked before spent $$$. The hub, echo and 2 switches will set you back about$220. But this setup is without a doubt AWESOME. The first test run with the switches , hub and echo went great. I can tell echo to turn off or on front and back floodlights or tell echo to turn all on or off as a group. I'm impressed and being an electrician by trade my mind is reeling with endless possibilities for this setup. Have reached a 2016 goal of total led, this year 2017 will be full automation of house... smart house.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|2|July 16, 2017|Alexa may overhear things not intended for her "ears"|Quite straightforward - gives me news and music when I ask. Sometimes it overhears conversations not intended for her ears. For example we were talking about dialling 911 in an adjoining room, and Alexa, taking this as an order, started to do so without being asked!! There should be a cross check by Alexa saying "Do you really want me to dial 911?". That would only add a couple of seconds to the response time. Matthew
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|August 15, 2017|Can't figure out why I would need an Echo....|People talk about needing speakers to pair with the Dot, but if you aren't listening to a lot of music, it's internal speakers work just fine.  My gripes with the system are that I seem to have to switch back and forth between the mobile Alexa app on my FIre and my PC based one account management options depending on what I want to manage or setup--this is likely a user issue and not a system issue.  Also the Dot in the kitchen cannot continue the News (Flash Briefing) at the point where the Dot in the bedroom left off, so must start over and "skip" everything I have already listened to.  Works great and I had no trouble integrating a Wemo mini smart plug for turning a lamp on and off, which was cheaper and more versatile than paying for a "smart" light bulb.  I wish the light rings could be disabled particularly at night--I'm going to have to make a "night cap" for my device.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|July 3, 2017|I'll be buying more of these!| My wife and I bought two of these. One for the great room in our house and one at String Theory Guitar Repair, my guitar repair shop. My wife and I use the one in the great room all the time for weather and time info and we're avid users of the shopping list. It's nice to have Alexa add items to the list and it's always on our devices when we go to the grocery. The traffic info is great too. We're going to add smart plugs and switches to give Alexa control of all our interior and exterior lighting very soon. In my my shop, Alexa controls a ceiling mounted shop fan and turns an amp on and off that's across the shop from my main repair bench. I'll be adding garage door control soon with a Nexx Garage device. We'll be adding an Echo to the master bathroom and our home office very soon.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|June 9, 2017|Such a fun/neat gadget to have around the house!|This is my 2nd Echo Dot as my 1st one freaked but I had the warranty so it could be replaced. I haven't had any issues with this one other than it did come on by itself one night and said it couldn't find the answer to the question I had asked. The house was quiet and I hadn't said anything so that was a tad freaky. It made me jump a bit and say a word that is similar to poop when it started talking!   The other thing is there are numerous commercials advertising Alexa now days and if the TV happens to be up loud enough my Echo will come on upon hearing the Alexa name and then it is confused about the question it was asked. If I can, I quickly place a rag, small pillow or blanket on top of it or try and hit the TV mute button when those commercials start to keep that from happening.   There are so many different things that can be asked of the Echo and a ton of music to choose from for it to play as well. I'm very pleased with mine!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|46|May 21, 2017|Echo Makeover|Decided that it worked so well that it needed and stylish makeover. So I secured it on an old radio box and the wooden box make the speakers so much more vibrant and the box I have lets me have all the buttons.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|May 8, 2017|New helper|I already had the Echo but decided to buy the Dot for my bedroom. The main differences between the two is the size and the difference in the speaker. I bluetoothed a speaker to my Dot for when we want to listen to music and it works great. I also had to rename the Dot as Amazon so that it doesn't pick up when we are talking to the Echo. I love being able to set timers, alarms, hear the news, and add things to my grocery or to-do list, all with my voice. I look forward to getting my Flash briefing every day. It's also handy for checking the weather to know how to dress for the day. The only complaint that I have is that it will sometimes trigger to come on if the tv is on in the same room, even when the name Amazon is not said. It's a minor annoyance and the benefits of having an Echo, far outweigh this. Not only is this a fun gadget but it's also very handy to have.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|May 10, 2017|We use it mainly for Lutron Caséta Wireless In-Wall Dimmer ...|We use it mainly for Lutron Caséta Wireless In-Wall Dimmer, for turning on stairs ,etc.  It works very well.  Occasionally use it for Amazon music and podcasts.  Other skills are meh.  So 4/5, but with new skills being added every month dots have a lot of promise. However, As of 5/10/2017, intercom between echo dots in same house is available, but no instructions provided by Amazon.  However, Just say "Alexa, call home" and the other dots will ring. Note: you may need to install Alexa app on phone and set up phone first. With this intercom skill, the dot are totally worthwhile for families with kids, etc.  Trying to find a decent wireless intercom is very difficult.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|2|June 30, 2017|Received as a gift!|Received this device as a Christmas gift and we love it! Its so handy for crazy questions and play whatever music you would like. We love to listen to music at night and its nice to play a playlist and at the same time set a timer so it isn't running all night. Will be giving this as gifts to my family members!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|27|December 3, 2016|Portable Echo without the Tap|So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables. Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|August 24, 2017|Love These Dots!!|I have the full size Echo and two Dots, and I love them!  I use them ALL THE TIME.  I didn't think I would at first, because I initially viewed these as more of a toy or source of entertainment.  When I discovered all the practical uses for the Echo, I couldn't wait to buy some Dots so I can have Alexa all over the house.  Now I don't have to get up and go to the main Echo to ask or tell Alexa something.  I use these for everything from making lists, setting alarms and timers, asking about the forecast for weather and traffic, playing music, controlling my smart home devices, and much more.  The Dot is a particularly good value for the money; the speakers are a bit tinny sounding but that is overcome if you add an external speaker for better sound quality.  I wholeheartedly recommend the Dot if you just want to try out all the things Alexa can do to help make your life a bit easier.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|August 26, 2017|This little dot far exceeded my expectations|This little dot far exceeded my expectations! I bought 2 of them from a local big box store and I will probably pick up a couple more for around the house. Having Alexa built-in is a life saver. It has been very responsive no matter where I am in the room. I love being able to ask almost anything and getting a valid response. Recently I hooked it up to my smart things hub. Controlling my lights and various gadgets by voice is a geek's dream come true. When it comes to local things like traffic and restaurants it could use some work but given Alexa hasn't been in the game as long as it's big "G" rival it holds up pretty well. The speaker itself is small but given it's size it does quite well. It can fill a medium sized room without too much trouble but don't expect amazing ranges from it.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|June 16, 2017|Perfect to play music while holding a baby!|I bought this for my kitchen because I was curious about whether Alexa is useful or not. What a great buy! My wife and I had never used Amazon music before, but now we listen to it all the time. The voice recognition works perfectly, even my 5 year old has no problem using it. My wife loves how she can select music, start/stop or change volume with voice commands while she is holding our baby daughter, since she would have no free hand to do it in the phone. Also, Amazon has great lullaby stations!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|August 22, 2017|A Great Combination of Fun and Very Useful|This quickly became one of my most favorite gadgets of all time. Before I was given one for Christmas I didn't think I'd have any use for it, but after two hours of playing with it I couldn't imagine life without it. I use it every day for everything from setting timers to playing music or sporting events, quick calculations, turning on lights and countless other fun and useful things. I could go on for hours about all of the different things I do and I have talked about it so much that my elderly parents finally decided they wanted one so I bought one for them. They are still getting the hang of using it, but one of its biggest benefits for me is that we can use it as an intercom between our houses in  case they need something and can't get to the phone. I love amazing people by showing them the wide array of things my little pal can do.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|July 2, 2017|We love it.|I absolutely love the Echo Dot.  I set my appointments, to do list, bible reading, daily text and weekly study, sleep sounds, and a few fun skills.  It took me a while to get the proper words down but the more I use it the better I will be.  I've been able to help my mom over the phone use hers more and we've even made calls to each other over it.  I'm not getting my husband to use it.  He loves Wikipedia knowledge and that he can ask for a specific song.  I would love it even more if my Cozi calendar app could be integrated.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|August 3, 2017|Our newest family member, "Alexa"...|We love our Echo Dot & got it fairly inexpensively during the Amazon Prime day. We don't have it hooked up to much, yet & are still learning but it's great fun! The only thing that might annoy someone is that if you say anything with the word "Alexa" in it, then it responds. Trying to tell someone about it while on the phone necessitated leaving the room when "she" took off talking! It was quite funny & in time I'm sure we'll remember to not do that & how to use it more effectively. I like the random info it gives & while we intended to use it mainly as a clock/radio, we regularly ask for a joke, put together shopping lists, to-do lists & set timers. Maybe when the novelty wears off we'll seriously learn how to use it more effectively. But in the meantime, we're having a blast with "Alexa"!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|July 23, 2017|Great little device for music, not so much for answering general questions.|This is a pretty cool device.  Alexa does not answer general questions as Google Home seems to.  When Alexa can't answer a question, I tell her she's stupid, and she makes a note of it; and hopefully Amazon will add a better general search skill (maybe it already exists and I haven't found it). On the other hand I got this to play music around the house, since I don't seem to have any audio equipment anymore, other than PCs, laptops and speakers, and of course a smartphone. This Dot is currently running through a Esinkin Bluetooth audio adapter into some nice speakers and works great.  I also have an Echo and although it has better sound than the Dot, I probably could have gotten off cheaper with a Dot and some Bluetooth speakers.  Prime music didn't meet all my needs, so I'm trying the Amazon Music trial.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|July 12, 2017|Alexa, ask 'npr one' to play 'how I built this.........'|I was offered the echo debut price of 99 a long time ago and held out until the 2017 prime day deal on the dot.  The dots speaker is great, I was very surprised actually.  For a single room, listening to podcasts, or music even, it beats the portable bluetooth speaker I had been using.  I would say that if you are thinking you are going to need a bigger speaker, get the dot first before you purchase a speaker to see if the dot alone meets your needs.  I will be pairing it with a new speaker because I'd already scored another awesome prime deal, but for other rooms in the future where I would like additional dots, I don't think it's necessary.  I had no issues with wifi set up, or connecting to bluetooth headphones.  I have used skills such as npr one app, flash briefings and amazon unlimited music.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|March 1, 2017|Love this - it's got a lot to learn but ...|Love this - it's got a lot to learn but it's certainly helpful around the house.  I can ask "what's the traffic" and she'll tell me how long it's going to take to get to work (pretty close in terms of timing); "add ____ to the shopping list" - I never forget the list on the counter since it shows up on the app; "play _____" radio station, Pandora channel, news flash - super helpful.  The speaker is decent, not great, so I just connected it to a Bluetooth speaker and it's perfect.  I got one to give as a gift - they love it as well.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|November 11, 2016|If your a big music fan you will love this little device|First off it's not the talking computer on star-track, but I wasn't expecting that. If your a big music fan you will love this little device. My only complaint is the Alexa android app is a piece of crap that really needs work. I'm glad i went with the Dot since it easily plugs into my existing sound system. I'll be picking up another for upstairs on the black Friday sale. I'll  wait a while to get LED bulbs etc. They are still first generation and over priced. BTW: these are fully portable, there is not battery but you can move them around the house, it just takes 30seconds or so for it to reconnect to your home wifi.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|July 22, 2017|What a little gem!|"She" takes only a little time to get used to, but the set-up did not go well the first time I tried it. The instructions need to be more definitive on what to do and when. That said, the sound quality is absolutely incredible given the very small size (on a solid surface). The response is very accurate although I did try to search for a composer who shares a name with a country and western singer so when I said, "play all by…" I got the wrong person until I specified "…by composer …" I very much like the change of color in the top light ring when she is asked for something. The quick change to blue tells me she is ready and listening, a fraction of a second after my speaking her name. So far, less than 2 weeks in, I am very glad I made the purchase! Next up will be a couple of the smart electrical sockets so I can have her do some lights on and off and that sort of thing.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|September 9, 2017|Loving my brand-new Echo Dot!|I am loving my Echo Dot and Alexa!  The Dot arrived this morning and a very helpful Amazon rep helped me over a glitch that occurred while trying to get my iPad, Dot, and wireless network to communicate with each other.  While waiting for Dot to arrive, I watched several YouTube videos which were helpful, and there is a lot of info available on Amazon's website.  I'm ancient and usually pretty tech-clueless, but I'm finding it really easy to learn how to ask Alexa questions.  She knows my favorite sports team and just told me where they are in the bottom of the 6th.  She played a cooking podcast for me, and she immediately connected me to my middle-of-nowhere radio station.  Best of all, the very first question I asked was, "Alexa, play 'Light My Fire' by The Doors," and she DID!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|March 6, 2017|I love the concept even though she's hard hearing at times|I love the concept even though she's hard hearing at times. She can't answer a lot of questions but she functions as a calculator, dictionary, timer, alarm clock, music streamer, and her skills are like apps on your phone and she has a few good ones. Overall, worth the price. Thanks Amazon, cool deal! Surprisingly, her speaker is nice and smooth sounding, although there is practically no bass at all. There is clear midrange and highs are present so the music is enjoyable through her. The speaker is on the bottom, interestingly done, but if you sit her on the bed you can't hear her well. =)
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|36,765|December 1, 2016|A new companion for my Brother With MS|My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion. Happy Holidays Roy
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|2|November 7, 2016|All kinds of awesome|If you're just going to use the Dot for podcasts, internet radio, news briefings, weather, home controls, etc., the included speaker in this little unit is fine.  If you listen to a lot of music, the Dot is really intended to use through an external speaker or audio system, via either a male-male headphone cable (not included) or Bluetooth. One great use for these is to turn an old clock radio that has an audio-in jack into a voice enabled internet radio and alarm.  I actually think Amazon would do well to release an Echo clock radio, but meanwhile retrofitting one with a Dot also works.  I converted two Logitech internet radios this way, and a standard stereo Sony clock radio.  This match up uses the superior speaker and clock display of the radios, but brings voice capabilities and internet radio/podcasts to your old device, not to mention everything else Alexa can do.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|July 1, 2017|I'm pleasantly surprised!|I purchased this to go along with a set of bookshelf speakers and as the centerpiece of a smart home system that I'm slowly investing in. I've been really impressed by Alexa. Most impressive to me is its ability to hear me. It still picks me up and understands over blaring music. I haven't even come close to taking advantage of all of its features yet, but so far I'm quite impressed and happy with this device! I did have an issue when setting it up. For some reason the app would just go blank when trying to set up Alexa on WiFi. I finally found a forum online that explained that the hybrid download/download boost mode on some smartphones will interfere with the ability of the phone to interface with Alexa during initial setup. It's the feature that lets you simultaneously download over WiFi and off your mobile network. I turned that off and it worked like a charm from there.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|June 25, 2017|From One Dot to Another - It's a Mutual Admiration Society|Echo Dot?  Where have you been all my life?  We've only had our Dots 24 hours but already we love them.  And don't let anyone tell you that you HAVE to purchase a bluetooth speaker to fully enjoy an Echo Dot or connect them to one.  We are finding the built-in speaker to be fine for listening to music and our Kindle books.  I'm sure if we were hardcore audiophiles, we'd probably pair up the bluetooth speaker but really, I've been cooking away in the kitchen and grooving to the beats with NO problems.  I was a tad nervous about whether or not my husband would like this (this was an anniversary gift I purchased for us and he's a techie kind of guy) but he is really enjoying discovering all the things we can do with it and how we can incorporate it into a "Smart Home."

B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|August 1, 2017|...except for the new volume buttons|I purchased another Echo Dot when they went on sale.  I currently own the Echo and another Echo Dot.  I wanted the white one to match décor and not stand out.  It works well just like my other Echos.  There are now plus (+) and minus (-) buttons on the top for the volume control instead of the ability to just turn the outer rim.  Of course, you can always just say "Alexa, turn the volume down".  I just happened to like the volume control the way it was, even though that is a small thing.  I started to give just 4 stars, but that seemed like a lot to knock off just because of one thing & there is no option for 1/2 .  Maybe there was a technical reason they changed it or it was a more popular idea with people.  For those of us that don't like the buttons, I guess we'll just talk to Alexa, that's always been the idea.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|May 28, 2017|... plugs and thermostats to full digital home and I'm happy that I got this Echo Dot to control the ...|I just started converting everything in my house from old 70s switches and plugs and thermostats to full digital home and I'm happy that I got this Echo Dot  to control the entire thing. We play music through it, it controls the temperature on my Nests. It controls all the wemo and plum lighting on my house. Works really well with everything including my fire stick. I haven't tried ordering pizza on it yet. But I'm sure that will be pretty easy too!  Also, the new app just added in communication like a speaker phone thing where you can talk to other people but also have the echo or through their app on their phone. Looking forward to trying this out as well!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|July 26, 2017|I'm not sure I need it.|Well, my Echo Dot was a gift. A piece of extra-computer tech for Father's Day gift for this 81-year-old great-grandfather. I buy most things via Amazon, but prefer that my eyes and fingers make the selection and the purchase. It's not that I can't speak, it's just that what-ever-her-name-is goes on to do other thing with other people when I pause my sentence to think of the next work. She did tell me one time how to make a pan of meatloaf, and I am told that she would have ordered me an onion if I had wanted her to do that and then wait for UPS, but I didn't have that much time before supper, so I found a can of dried onion flakes as a substitute. When the grand kids are here, I sometime show off and ask her stuff and that thrills the gift giver, but about half the time I call her Siri and my wife's cell phone answers me. I am not sure I really NEED the Dot, but I love it.

I live in a 966 sq ft home and Alexa can hear me from any room.  I could barely hear her from some rooms though, so I ordered the Oontz Angle 3 Plus bluetooth speaker on sale for $35 on Monday and received it today (Wednesday.). What a difference!  Now I can hear Alexa from anywhere in my house and it does an awesome job playing music as well  The Oontz paired easily with the Echo Dot 2 and it also paired easily with my Fire Tablet, mobile phone and laptop computer.  Highly recommend both of these products.

The Dots are perfect for coverage in multiple rooms and we have even used two of them to install into our vehicles! I know Amazon is working on getting Alexa in vehicles now and has several agreements, but it's easy enough to do already to retrofit an existing vehicle. All you need is: - Hotspot - Either use your phone or install a permanent hot spot into your vehicle such as the Verizon Hum+ or similar solution by other carriers - USB power for the Echo Dot - Aux in for the car radio is what I use in both our vehicles It's fun to have Alexa on the go now, and we're hooked on the home automation integration we've been able to do with it. Our entire home can be controlled by Alexa from opening/closing the garage door, to setting the security (we don't allow her to disarm), turning on the main water feed through via the watercop system we have, controlling all the lights in the house, and putting the projector screen down and turning on the projector in our home theater when it is movie time, to name a few things. Looking forward to Alexa having better information search capability but they keep adding features and this has closed the gap on mainstream home automation to the masses. I've been in home automation for over 18 years, and this brings it to the next level!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|December 1, 2016|The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70|Instead of getting the larger Echo, I bought this to use with a pair of Bose speakers powered by cheap amplifier (also from Amazon). The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70, as the speakers were given to me. I must say, I am really impressed. The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience. I'm starting to sweat from all these keystrokes, but I would definitely recommend this to the gadget lover and lazy person alike.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|June 12, 2017|Alexa may as well have been my daughters first words|I have nothing negative to say about Echo Dot's - I own three of them and I can't believe how much use they get. From playing nursery music while my daughter sleeps (in do-not-disturb mode to prevent sounds from waking her up), to calling her grandparents so they can hear the new words she is learning, this device is invaluable. Add in a home automation system (I'm using SmartThings), this device now controls my lights, front door lock, multiple outlets and even arms my house on the way out. My fiancee, while not as adept in using it as I am, has no problems controlling the house as well - and spending time each day to play Jeopardy on it. Finally, my daughter (10 months) is and has always been infatuated with Alexa - walking up to our dots to say "Hi" and getting excited when we have Alexa talk back ("Alexa, Simon Says ... "). I'm screwed the moment she learns how to invoke voice commands herself.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|8|November 3, 2016|It's a Must Buy!|I'm loving my dot.  It's the perfect product to transform your ordinarty home into a SMART HOME!  Everyone in my family uses it and I mean everyone.  My wife loves to use the timers when cooking, I love it using with all my smart home technology to include the Nest Thermosta, Philips Hue Bulbs, Smarthings, Automatic, the list goes on!  Not to mention my 2 year old son has even learned how to get Alexa to play his favoriite songs!  I purchased two of them and I'm about to buy my 3rd!  Have I mentioned it's about to work with SONOS!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|2|June 30, 2017|Loud Enough & Worth the Money|Loud enough to hear in the same room, even on the kitchen with the sink running. Maybe not loud enough for having friends over.  It's as loud as you should need as a decent condo/apartment neighbor. Good music selection with my Amazon Prime. Definitely worth the money compared to a similarly priced Bluetooth speaker.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|5|November 30, 2016|Would make for an excellent Xmas gift|I never do reviews, but this thing is so life-changing, I just had to do one just to give it 5 stars. I can't believe I didn't get this sooner. Would make for an excellent Xmas gift. The microphone captures commands easily and  set-up was a breeze.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|December 7, 2016|Fun, Easy, & Super Helpful!|This little tool is the best. I purchased on several months ago and it is a household favorite. I use it daily to update my shopping list, listen to music, set timers (I wear hearing aids and don't hear the microwaver timer but Alexa comes through loud and clear!) and check the news and weather. My kids love it to check homework (Alexa is GREAT at math!), and play games such as 20 questions.  It is small and non-intrusive with your home decor.  This purchase is for a Christmas gift - my father quizzes Alexa whenever he is at my house, so this is for him.  I highly recommend Alexa- specifically this small Echo Dot - and a small bluetooth speaker to use it with.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|July 17, 2017|Part of the Family|It works great. The sound quality is very good. We are still learning and sometimes we don't get a response to a questions. On the other hand, we asked it how long was the local post office open, and it was able to tell us.  The funniest thing happened, we were speaking to each other, and Alexa answered my husband at one point in our conversation. He responded "Alexa I wasn't talking to you!" She responded "That wasn't a very nice thing to say" We burst out laughing!
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|One|July 14, 2017|Awesome alternative to the full size models|The Echo Dot is great for smaller rooms like offices, bathrooms or bedrooms. You still get all the functionality of Alexa without having a large echo or tap unit as an eye sore in the room. You do lose volume with the smaller Dot but in a smaller space it doesn't really make a difference. If you buy this make sure to take advantage of the Alaxa newsletter so you get all of the new (they add stuff every week) functionality and apps out of it. Also take a look at the app wiki so you can activate all the stuff you will actually use.

Alexa does with no problem...... i am going to get the big one now because i am enjoying yelling commands at this little thing so much. i know the music sounds way better on the big one..... maybe it will go on sale after Xmas??
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|January 26, 2017|Can't believe I ever lived without one!|Love Alexa so much!  I use it mainly to control the lights in my house, but I know she can do so much more. I have some problems making it interface w/my Ecobee 3, it most often says it can't perform that function even though it is connected and set up properly, but considering it works fine everywhere else, I'm okay w/that. Small, non descript, most people don't even notice it even thought it sits right in front of my TV. Very responsive, hears me 95% of the time (and sometimes picks up random things from the TV), even from the other room, and I can talk in a normal voice, not yell (XBOX you need to step up your game, you hardly ever hear me even when I scream at you!) Wish it was more interactive with other smart home products (like my receiver so I could change the volume on my sound system), and the shopping list worked better w/OneNote. Still needs improvement, but I can't imagine going back to life w/out Alexa.
B01DFKC2SO|5.0|0|July 22, 2017|Good investment and added Great Sound|I connected my Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker to the Dot and it sounds great! I think better than my larger size Echo. It paired up nicely with a  simple Alexa -  connect speaker - commands. The Dot works as well as the larger Echo and fits more easily on a crowded desk top or night stand. Searching the net I was able to find multiple lists of Echo commands that have made the device more of a friendly helper than a novelty item. I did not use my first Echo (the larger one) much until I made a list of the most helpful and popular commands for a friend. I saved a copy of those commands and started using them until they became part of my daily routine. Now I have my Honeywell home thermostat. living room lights, outside cameras, SiriusXM all linked to my Echo and Dot. The effort you put into making a list of helpful Alexa commands and using them daily should add value and make this investment worth the price many times over.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|1|August 21, 2017|1980 big screen shrunken down, its a great conversation piece for jokes.|Unless you have ALOT of people with one I would just suggest the Echo.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|3|July 23, 2017|Waste of my money|Waste of my money. Bought this as the center of my smart home and it's been a pain. The video feeds for my cameras barely work and Alexa is horrible at commands. Trying to get it to take skills to use my products could be way easier. I wish Google home would drop an equivalent to this.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|8|August 8, 2017|Temperamental Device with sub par customer support|The device has potential but is not ready for prime time. If you are fortunate enough to have a device that works, don't make any changes to it or how you use it. Once you try to add skills, subscribe to a prime video channel or anything of the like, it's all down hill. I used the echo show for a month, and it was growing on me despite some of the quirks with Alexa. I subscribed to Full Screen and it worked for one day. After that, the show would no longer play any Amazon Prime videos. After spending an hour with Amazon support and talking to 3 people, none of which were truly paying attention to what I had to say, they tell me they will contact an engineer and get back to me in 2 days. Thankfully, I have a 45 day return policy to Best Buy, where I will be taking it and using my iPad Pro instead.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|2|July 12, 2017|One Star|ERRATIC, VERY LIMITED REAL UTILITY.  NOT WORTH BOTHERING WITH
B01J24C0TI|1.0|2|September 5, 2017|Do not buy|Echo arrived in time but is doa on arrival, I actually ordered 2 and both took multiple reboots and an hr to setup. Finally when they were running, as I had it play music it would keep crashing and rebooting. The second device rebooted at least 4-6 times per day. I'll be returning them
B01J24C0TI|1.0|1|July 31, 2017|Not great product|The information Alexa gives is most of the time not recent.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|3|September 19, 2017|One Star|The speakers are horrendous.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|1|September 21, 2017|BEWARE - this may be useless for you if you don't have the right smart phone|If I could give -5 stars, I would. Be aware: if you do not have a smart phone -- and a fairly new one at that (5.0 android or above) this will not do the drop in calls that are so highly recommended for elderly parents. I wasted hours and endured much disappointment because this is how it is. Very bad move, Amazon.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|8|August 19, 2017|Not worth the price|Not much different than the amazon echo. Yes it has a display but the use cases are limited. For instance, I can only watch a few Amazon shows and to do this I must enable this skill. Each show is a skill. There are only a few shows. On top of that the device is buggy. YouTube videos will not play. Long lines of code appear on the display on the home screen and in Youtube. One of the pros is you can now see what you are buying. But I'd rather use a computer so I can compare prices at other stores.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|2|July 22, 2017|A lack of clear and effective Setup instructions relegate our Echo Show experience an exercise in great frustration!|We have an original Echo and a 2nd gen Echo Dot so we are experienced Echo users. Received the Echo Show as a Father's Day gift so we could share f2f communications with our 5 month old granddaughter. The "Show" looks good has great sound and excellent screen resolution. It will NOT import my entire contact list and we can NOT  initiate a video call.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED 😔
B01J24C0TI|1.0|29|June 29, 2017|Not Recommended|Update: I'm returning the device as there is still no way to turn off the text ("suggestions") and my 30 days id's almost up. Never buy version 1 of anything. If they fix it I might repurchase. Device is OK but the home screen is cluttered and busy with text that you can't turn off.  If you want to display your photos they can barely be seen because of the time, temperature and the text.  If you turn off the trending topics you get an endless stream of Alexa tips but there's no way to turn off the text.  Maybe they should test the O/S before releasing it to the public.  I saw the flaw right out of the box, called tech support and listened for 30 minutes while the rep guessed at ways to turn off the text none of which worked.  I asked for a supervisor and was finally told that you can't turn off the text.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|0|September 19, 2017|F grade.  Utterly stupid and unreliable.|This is an utter mess.  Voice parsing is laugable.  You can use the screen suggestions and have them fail. Every time the freakin software is updated it loses WiFi. F grade. Update:  More failures to access the on screen suggestions.  Many.  Utter junk.  DO NOT BUY
B01J24C0TI|1.0|4|July 29, 2017|Not quite ready for syncing calendars.|The calendar sync with Outlook was the main reason we bought one. Unfortunately it was unable to sync in either direction with Outlook on my iPhone 7+.  The issue was escalated to the development team but have not received any update in a week so I returned the unit.  Maybe later when the sync issue is resolved I'll repurchase another one.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|7|July 23, 2017|Amazon should ask customers to agree to Beta test the device when purchasing|Having used it for a week, I'm returning it.  50-60% of the time, it either does not understand what I've asked it to do, or it does it incorrectly.  Besides this, I feel the device is WAY overpriced.  The OS feels like a tablet from the early 2000's. The real nail in the coffin was that after syncing the device with my phone, the alexa app doesn't have my most of my contacts detected with no explanation or help readily available. I have neither the time nor the desire to beta test this device for Amazon anymore.

Currently not working after one week of use. I was so excited to get this. Likely will be sending it back
B01J24C0TI|1.0|5|August 26, 2017|Amazon needs to fix this|Very disappointed. After having 5 echo devices. This one really ruined my experience. Very bad recognition. Gets stuck listening. Understands 1 of 3 of my commands
B01J24C0TI|1.0|5|September 8, 2017|Alexa needs to learn more skills|Alexa continues to say she can't or doesnt know that.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|28|August 7, 2017|Maybe will get better over time|The potential is definitely there, but currently getting held back by buggy and feature lacking software. Basic image search barely works, and basic listening skills a significantly sub par from either of the Echos. Requires frequent reboots to keep stable. Amazon - get this right!!!
B01J24C0TI|1.0|30|July 14, 2017|Need a rep to contact me about the Echo Show, so far it is not doing very well.|I am looking for a way to get the attention of someone at the company since there are no instructions to contact a rep about this product. The device will not pair with my account so many of the features that I use the regular Echo device for will not even work on this device because it won't properly pair the account to my app. There is no way to reset or re-pair the device from what I can see, and there is no help me section for the device either. Right now I have a small box tv that randomly shows whatever it wants to show and not what I would like it to do. Can someone please contact me for assistance. I didn't want to put it out here on this forum but I don't have much of a choice since Amazon seems to hide any way to talk to a person about an issue with a product they have.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|1|August 15, 2017|Worth it once the problems are sorted out!|I was excited by the possibilities for this device but was disappointed by its execution. In particular, Echo Show often misheard me, which doesn’t seem to happen very often with my original Echo. Few skills take advantage of the screen but even if they do add support the responsiveness of the touchscreen will make for a bad experience. I will be returning this product and waiting for the next iteration.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|2|July 17, 2017|Echo show not responding|My echo show worked 5 minutes ago and now it is not responding. It is still hooked to my wifi. What could be the problem?
B01J24C0TI|1.0|2|July 19, 2017|This lack of backward compatibility with my old Echo was annoying to the point that I decided to return the ...|This unit was not at all compatible with what I already set up on my Echo.  It did not know any of the control commands (like shut off the lights) and wanted me to "reprogram" it separately (I already spent many, many hours getting the Echo to work with my automated home products -and, for some reason, the Show COULD NOT SEAMLESSLY REPLACE THE ECHO FEATURES).  This lack of backward compatibility with my old Echo was annoying to the point that I decided to return the Show rather than spend hours getting it to work.  Unlike the Echo, it is very difficult to know when Alexa wakes when standing behind the unit  because it does not have a light on the back or sides (like Echo's revolving light display).  You can turn on an audible alert of Alexa's waking, but that disappears when power is lost (as does the wake word for my Dot)  and is not loud enough to be effective.  And, speaking of sound, THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SHOW IS VERY MUCH INFERIOR TO THE ECHO.  The unit does not have 360 degree sound and the volume is most  inferior to the Echo.  I simply had to return this  product because I feel that it was not well thought out. before launching.

B01J24C0TI|1.0|1|September 18, 2017|Lacking Customer Service|electricity was turned off briefly and now it doesn't work.  I had this happen with a previous Echo product and could never get customer service to help.  I'm sorry I bought another Echo product.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|4|August 24, 2017|DON'T PURCHASE IF YOU HAVE T-MOBILE|DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE T-MOBILE.  Echo show has to send a verification code (5 digits) for you to get full functionality. T-Mobile blocks it.  They won't remove it and Amazon has no fix for it which I think smells of incompetence.  Good job tech team.  Neither one will take responsibility.  Called T-Mobile and they said they don't work with the Alexa app.  I put this on Amazon...Ripping off t-mobile users.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|6|July 23, 2017|Try hey Alexa stop showing me what I can do|I thought this was gonna be a really great addition to the echo family. Even after you turn off all the home screen spam options it comes with, your still left with a constant try hey Alexa show me traffic and other tips of things you can do. Even when you sync your calendar and try to get it to just show your up next, underneath is still try hey Alexa spam. Highly disappointed I was hoping for a cool clock and weather display/ calendar and not scrolling tips for Alexa. Totally cheapens the asthetic of the device.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|9|July 12, 2017|Don't waste your money|Was only good for music was no help in calling people with echo devices stopped working after 3 days
B01J24C0TI|1.0|1|September 19, 2017|Disappointed|This device has been a huge disappointment. I have to repeat nearly every request multiple times, carefully articulating every syllable. I do not experience the same issues with either of the two echos. Wish I had bought a third one instead of this paperweight.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|2|August 4, 2017|One Star|Response time is slow ..very slow

Trying to get it to play the YouTube video I was is nearly impossible. Why can I just cast it from my phone? Oh wait I should be using voice, but something is wrong the search. The same query on my phone shows something completely different and wrong on the Echo Show. Sometimes it shows a query saying ask Alexa ... and I ask it, but the device says I don't know anything about that. What the hell? Save your money. Just stick to the Echo and the dot.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|1|September 3, 2017|Not worth the money.|I thought it would work with Netflix and other tv shows but it doesn't, only YouTube which I could care less about and Amazon video. Not really where it should be as far as tech is concerned, so this definitely needs some upgrades and should be much cheaper for now. My original echo listens much better overall.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|0|September 19, 2017|One Star|It doesn't listen
B01J24C0TI|1.0|5|September 10, 2017|Do Not Buy- Unless you like Ad's|Do Not Buy! Great start but! There is a rotating ad that says "Try this or that with Alexa" It you can not turn it off! I have 4 devices in my home for over a year and know how to work them. My family and friends are returning 6 in total due to this rotating ad. Dont buy until they fix this. I have called many times in the last month with no definite answer if the next software release will have an option to turn it off. If you have your photo slide show turned on,  it is covered in words by Amazon.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|5|August 22, 2017|Should have waited.|Product is mediocre at best. The software leaves a lot to be desired. I specifically have to ask mine 3 times to shut off the screen before it actually stays off. Should have waited a year till they actually have a decent product.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|5|July 13, 2017|Current owners should wait|WAIT FOR v2 - Seriosuly!!!  I have 4 Shows (arrived on the 28th), 3 Echos and 4 Dots.  They are our most useful home appliance: lights, temp, lists, calendar, music, 'who-was-president-when',  Alexa owners know how useful they are. HOWEVER  Amazon has recently released updates that add features many owners have wanted for 2 years. You get EVERYTHING YOU'VE ASKED FOR <minus video>. Go ahead and buy a Show. They work equally as well as the Dot or Echo.  After 3 weeks, ask yourself "'what does the Show REALLY do that it is over-and-above my Echo or Dot?" . Screenshots
B01J24C0TI|1.0|5|August 22, 2017|I an unplugging this useless unit!|Doesn't support the ring door bell properly.  Only lists CNN as a new source!!  I an unplugging this useless unit!
B01J24C0TI|1.0|5|August 17, 2017|JUNK|This is my third Echo-- and I only added this to monitor a nest cam in my child's room without leaving my phone on all night. The Echo Show is a poor substitute. The screen constantly goes grey and displays "Buffering..." and then the live video randomly just shuts down and the Show returns to a home screen. USELESS. Clearly a beta product.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|7|July 25, 2017|Awkward to handle|I got the two pack deal, the sound sucks, when I ask to show my Prime watchlist it pops up whatever the latest movies are available on Prime.  The Dot does just as well or better.  I have a couple of days before I can send them back, they're going back. -- They are heavy and awkward to handle,  What I really don't like is the wall wart plug is hardwired to the Show unlike the Dot where you can remove the power plug, I feel eventually this configuration could be pulled out due to a drop or develop a short due to bending as the Show gets moved around,
B01J24C0TI|1.0|1|August 29, 2017|Unreliable.|My prime photos won't show on home screen anymore.  Unreliable
B01J24C0TI|1.0|19|July 16, 2017|WAIT FOR 2ND GENERATION - LOTS OF BUGS, SLOW, POOR SPEECH RECOGNITION AND ACCURACY COMPARED TO OTHER ECHOS|Bought two and sent them both back.  I have used the Echo and Echo Dot.  Compared to those, this unit is MUCH SLOWER and does not pick up voice recognition as well.  The video feature needs a lot of perfecting.  Not many of the "SKILLS" are applicable.  Came across several bugs, like accuracy, speed, freezing screens, and horrible video touch screen interface.  Save your money and wait for the second generation to come out.  This one stinks.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|0|July 23, 2017|One Star|Too limited in what you can do/watch video wise
B01J24C0TI|1.0|31|July 12, 2017|Less functional than the DOT|For some reason the Show doesn't pick up my voice/dictation as well as the Dot. It's always getting words wrong that the Dot picks up fine. If they are using the same servers and dictation software, I'm not sure why there would be a difference, but there is. Most of the time I will ask the Show to play music and the light will come on indicating that it's listening, but the Show does not respond and the light times out and nothing happens. The speakers sound good for the size, but overall I'm disapointed mostly because it has proven to be much less useful than the Dot  which I have located in the same room. I'm using different wake commands, so I know that one is not interfering with the response of the other. The screen is cool, but there isn't much UI/UX to do anything with. Since the dictation is always wrong I would like to be able to type seachers for music or youtube. Thinking about returning it, but I've always been a fan of Amazon so hopfully an update will fix the bugs and all will be right again.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|6|July 16, 2017|Doesn't seem to hear very well!  As deaf as Grandma.|I have multiple other Alexa devices, including a new Element TV.  It's not like this is new to me. The listening skills of Echo Show are junk. its in my kitchen, and most of the time when I say"Alexa", the Dot in the living room will answer. I literally have to get within 2 feet of it, and speak loudly.  The only positive thing about this device is its ability to stream lyrics while playing music. I can now see what some of the mumbled lyrics of 70s songs are. Really, really disappointed. Wish I'd never wasted my money!
B01J24C0TI|1.0|3|August 25, 2017|I find no significant use for it other than spend money on something new with no great value!|This offers little for the cost over a plain Echo, which I own. One of the features I was hoping to get was the capacity to se and track local weather radar similar to to what the Sony Dash used to do.  If I want to listen to radio music I will turn on the type of music I want to listen to.  Echo choices of music is no big deal.  I doesn't do anything I want more than Echo...Maybe it is because there are no operating instructions to tweek my interest in its full capability.  I don't want to take the time for a learning cure that may be fruitless through playing with this new toy to see what it will provide.  I find no significant use for it other than spend money on something new with no great value!
B01J24C0TI|1.0|27|August 7, 2017|This must be version 0. 05. You should ...|This must be version 0.05.  You should wait for version 0.1 at least.  This thing is worthless.  Alexa app to manage this is full of bugs.  Will not accept a valid address among other things.
B01J24C0TI|1.0|19|June 30, 2017|Upsetting.....|Very upsetting that there is no way to turn off the cluttered text on the main home screen.  Just got off the phone with technical support and they confirmed that there is no way to get rid of the things to try text messages.  It's something hey are working on.  So basically you can set a background pic but can't see it through the advertisement. Edited:  lowered my rating since this still isn't fixed.  Horrible.  The tips are distractin and I don't care about them.  They are useless in your screen and distract from the picture.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 26, 2017|Ok but could do much better, hopefully sw updates will get it there someday.|This is not as good as what I hoped, mainly because I think the software is not really ready yet. For instance there is NO voice training as we the other alexa products.  Also I think that there could me more potential to take advantage of the screen.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|3|July 2, 2017|Great Concept, but major smart home connectivity issues|Alexa is great, and the voice recognition is incredible. Takes a learning curve on how phrase requests, but overall user friendly. My biggest complaint, and it's a BIG one, is after spending 3 days attempting to connect my smart bulbs (HUE and WeMo), talking with Amazon support, etc. NONE of my smart bulbs have been able to be connected. This is almost a deal breaker for me. If I can't get it figured out soon. I may return them both.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|3|July 2, 2017|Far from my expectation. Integration with Ring and Arlo ...|Far from my expectation. Integration with Ring and Arlo works ok but connection takes such a long time. Voice command doesn't work well. Spotify command is poorly implemented.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|2|July 4, 2017|Several features that should have been easy to make available|This thing has so much potential but falls quite sure of its promise. Several features that should have been easy to make available, but are not there: 1) Using the device's built-in camera/microphone as a security camera (accessible through the app on phone or another echo show device).  This is not equivalent to a "Drop In".  I want it to be discreet... 2) Direct access to apple music with an app (or "skill") rather than through me uploading the same music to Amazon cloud, or through bluetooth and iphone 3) Using the device as electronic picture frame with direct access to Photos in Mac OSx.  And no I dont want to copy all my photos into Amazon cloud! I can go on and on. I understand that Amazon and Apple compete in some of these areas, but I am not going to change my entire infrastructure to an Amazon based infra (it is not even possible as there are no equivalents to a Mac Book from Amazon!) just to be able to use Echo Show. Unfortunately I am returning my devices...
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|August 14, 2017|As good as the standard echo, but not much more|I am a huge fan of the echo series and own an echo, two echo dots, a tap, and now the echo show. The show can do everything that the other echos can, but it seems to be just a little bit slower in executing any voice commands. The 2 stars comes from the lack of screen use. Camera support is pretty terrible. If you look at any of the camera skills, they all have bad reviews because of how laggy they are. If you can get them working, the feed is around 10 seconds behind the live view. Amcrest in particular is bad, and unless you pay a subscription fee, you can only have one camera that is viewable. Other cameras let you have more, but the lag time is still there. Overall, I use this the same as the standard echo, so it is hard to justify the extra money for a screen, when the best feature (in my opinion) is sub par.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|4|July 2, 2017|Connectivity Issues Get In the Way|Has potential but going to be sending back mainly for connectivity issues. Accessing my Spotify account on the Echo was never a problem but the Show seems to have lots of difficulty. For other commands there seems to be a big lag at times and often Alexa tells me that she is having trouble connecting but will still keep trying. I connected my phone to the Bluetooth and any time something makes a noise on my phone it will stop any music on the Show and then the Bluetooth screen shows up - I disconnected the BT but never had that problem on the Echo. I have to then ask to play music again or give the command of what ever was playing prior to the interruption. I have tried restarting and connecting to both 2.4 and 5 ghz but to doesn't seem to solve it. As others have mentioned, the continuous scrolls are annoying and would hope they would issue the option to turn those off. On the plus size the speakers are very nice and the other visual capabilities look nice, but can only do so much if I can't stay connected. I'm going to try an exchange in the off chance I got a lemon but based on some of the other reviews it sounds like this isn't uncommon.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 12, 2017|Not that good as it seems or advertised.|It only works for Video conferencing - that's it....
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 8, 2017|Really great product but it's not ready for prime time|Really great product but it's not ready for prime time, the software looks more like a beta version, still missing a lot of basic features and settings. Yo can't change the info on the home screen,  Another HUGE issue is that only works with a US address, our company has an office in South America and another one in Europe and I usually work in those offices a few months a year and the Echo Show is a big NO if you try to use it oversees, I work for a tech company so I know it's extremely easy for Amazon to allow to enter a city or state that is not in the US for the local weather and other features. I will change my review to 5 stars once they fix all these issues and they make the OS more user friendly and allow us to fully customize the home screen and other features to better suit our needs. Oh I almost forgot to mention that the sound is pretty good for a small device.

Needs to connect to more devices like Belkin cameras Nest thermostat took over a day for Alexa to find Music feature is good Trying to get Alexa to play a video kept giving me Kindle books Hope this is not the next amazon phone fiasco

When Alexa is talking her voice is so garbled that I can't understand her, and the music sound is even worse. If I turn the sound down to its lowest setting, it isn't garbled but then I can't hear anything.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 27, 2017|it's almost like all its good for is two-way with grandma and ...|Returned this item.  Felt it was behind its time.  Bought it for my bedroom.  Screen was too small, functionality not all there for me, limited in functions, no two-way communication with Ring app, sound quality and volume was ok...not overwhelming and deserving of the hype as described, search results were very broad.  True, it's almost like all its good for is two-way with grandma and grandpa, close family, and friends...but dont' expect many of mine to shell out the $250 (w/tax) to have this luxury.  Of the 3,000 contacts between my wife and I,  about 10% own echos, 2 had a show and they were clients. Will wait till tech catches up, screen is bigger, and speakers fill the room.  Sorry Amazon...I have two echos and 3 dots...this one missed the boat.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|15|July 9, 2017|... number of Echo devices and have always been very satisfied. However|I have a number of Echo devices and have always been very satisfied. However, the Show contains an annoyance that I just can't get past. I've turned off trending topics and notifications in Home Card Pereferences and still get constant annoying messages to try this and try that. I don't want to Wiki Star Trek nor do I want to ask Alexa what another word for Happy is. Seriously??!! All I want on my home screen is for it to scroll thru my own pics (and this works) and then display the time and temperature...no suggestions to try asking Alexa things I don't care about. All these suggestions just clutter the screen to the point where the automatic scrolling thru my own pics looses it's appeal as I barely see the pics thru the suggestions that clutter the screen.  If they don't create an option to get rid of all the junk soon with a software update, this thing goes back.

B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|August 19, 2017|do not take it outside the US|hello it seems that Echo show will not work out side US , so pls be careful if you intend to take the Echo show outside the US , this is what i have done and unfortunately i am stack with it , hope Amazon will soon expand this and will rectify it
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 13, 2017|Disappointed|I am a little disappointed in it, I thought it would show u-tube videos and more pictures similar to my iPhone but it doesn't at this time. I am hoping that as the software updates it will show more videos and pictures. Pick up news pictures and videos.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|0|July 4, 2017|Poor Sound Quality|The quality of the sound for music is below average.  For this reason I am returning the Echo Show.  A bit disappointed but I am sure they will get it corrected with the next model.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|August 19, 2017|It will hopefully get better.|I still enjoy it but it is annoying with my southern accent. It should be able to look stuff up. You hear that it can't answer your question more than anything does. I love the feature that lets it read kindle books to you. I do wish it would access my Netflix and Hulu account.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|8|July 3, 2017|Would be a great device, but there is a very annoying "try ...|Would be a great device, but there is a very annoying "try this" message you can't get to go away.  While you are playing music it will have something on the screen that says "try this, ask alexa to play a game"  or "try this, tell alexa to turn up the volume".  Makes it look cheap and I already know these things so I would like to be able to turn off notifications.  Please Amazon!
B01J24C0TI|2.0|3|July 7, 2017|Disappointed Fan|I was one of the early beta adopters of Echo and subsequently added 3 dots around the house. Control lighting, Sonos, Dyson and Nest devices and am addicted to voice OS. Thought I had to add the Show but after 2 weeks am disappointed. Sub-standard and spotty voice recogntion, no audio out, small screen that adds little and is too tethered for family video calls. I think its on the way to becoming part of my museum of misguided tech purchases
B01J24C0TI|2.0|2|July 12, 2017|to hard for us old people.|to hard for us old people .have trouble with alexa just sometimes don't answer when I talk to it
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 12, 2017|Problems communicating|While it is great for playing music, it is no better than the Echo or Dot; set up with Fire Phone and Kindle's for communicating is a compatibility problem. One which tech support was not aware of! In order to maximise use would have to buy a new phone and/or other than Kindle tablet, dumber than a box of rocks!
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|August 15, 2017|... a web camera to the Show - it isn't good enough. The video delay from the web camera ...|If using it for a live feed from a web camera to the Show - it isn't good enough. The video delay from the web camera (Logi Circle) to the Echo Snow was 10 seconds - way too long. When I used the app that came with the camera, the video delay was only 2 seconds. For this to be an effective live feed display unit, the delay needs to be greatly reduced to around 2 seconds if not shorter. On a positive side, the video quality was quite good. Worked with Amazon support for about 90 minutes but the delay was never reduced. Both the camera and the Show were on the same wireless network. Looked cool, good idea, not ready yet.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|August 19, 2017|Nice concept, still a lot of improvement to go.|Still a lot of bugs to iron out.  Freezes a lot, screen does. It did very well so don't recommend putting it near your bed.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|2|July 13, 2017|Not ready yet|Having owned all the echo products to this point, I just couldn't find any way the show added to the equation. Tried it in kitchen but angle to view it was awkward. In bedroom it was no better as an alarm clock than the dot. It also had a much larger footprint than it appears in the photos. A few years back there was the chumby and Sony dash, they had more available to them then this does now. I'm sure amazon will get it right either the second or third generation, but not yet
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|August 19, 2017|The set up was easy, but less than a week later Alexa will ...|It arrived quickly. The set up was easy, but less than a week later Alexa will not connect at all even though i have no issues with wifi and internet for my other devices. Disappointing.I have to get them to help.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|6|July 1, 2017|Inferior Next Gen Product, centered on subscription and service sales.|Not especially impressive. Big money grab, like having constant salesman in my living room, like Apple, Amazon pushes their services and products just a little too far. Where I love the Echo, I must say this seems like an inferior next gen, heavily considering returning. Screen is very small, AI is limited, couldn't get lyrics without subscription plan. Haven't tried face to face call yet, unsure if I need a synched cell, and no one else I know has a "Show".  On the whole, very disappointing.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|2|July 2, 2017|Returned.  Maybe the next iteration will be better|I decided to return my Show.  It looses contact with the wireless network, which is located about 4 feet from the Show on a regular basis.  And I cant figure out how to change the network or reset the thing.  I have 6 regular echos and am  very happy with the however this device, at least for me, is not worth the price of several standard echos.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|4|June 30, 2017|Muffled sound|Voice rendition is muffled and worse off axis so understanding Alexa from another room is difficult. Music just okay fat on the bottom and rolled off at the top.  As to the display, would like greater control over brightness and sleep mode. Also discovered I primarily use Alexa when I'm moving about and prefer using Alexa app on my iPhone or iPad rather than returning to Show. This is a new concept and 3rd parties will roll out novel uses.  I have two Echos and a Dot which I love but am returning the Show because of the poor voice rendition.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|3|July 3, 2017|Not Impressed|Not impressed at all. Great concept but the Touchscreen is limited in functionality. I am returning it and sticking with my Echo.i will wait for second gen.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|August 25, 2017|my smaller Bluetooth speaker sounds better. Also|Sound quality huge letdown, my smaller Bluetooth speaker sounds better.  Also, the screen wasnt very useful, thought for sure when someone rang my ring doorbell the Echo show would display it but no doesnt even do that.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|0|July 4, 2017|Caution.  Needs cell phone service|Caution.  The echo devices including the Show require a cell phone number and service to make video calls, voice calls and messaging.  This is not a stand alone unit by which calls can be made through the internet like FaceTime on an iPad.  I love all the other features Alexa devices offer but am greatly disappointed that these devices require cell phone service.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|6|June 30, 2017|Should be called the Meh Show, not Echo Show.|I've had the original Alexa since it first came out Jan 2015 and have been impressed with the functionality Amazon has added to it. Since Amazon has had over two years to play with Alexa, I would have thought that the new Echo Show would have been more impressive than it is. At this point, it's nothng more than the original Echo with an added 7" screen. Not too impressed with what you can do with the screen. A cheap used iPad Mini with Siri  can do more at this point. Also, the sound quality isn't much better than the original Echo. Can't compare to a Sonos:1. Back it goes to Amazon until they make major improvements. Sorry Jeff, nice try, but you whiffed this one.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|0|July 12, 2017|Two Stars|Thought it would be better
B01J24C0TI|2.0|2|August 19, 2017|Unimpressive Piece of Tech With Lots of Bugs and Failures|Very unhappy overall with the Echo Show.  I purchased at Best Buy and used it for about 20 days.  My conclusion: Going to return it.  I like the idea of having a screen but the execution is terrible.  For example, the Echo Show displays rotating news stories and underneath says "Alexa, tell me about X" to hear more about the story.  Asking Alexa about those stories almost NEVER works.  Other clunky interface examples: When listening to music, I like the idea of showing lyrics but it doesnt actually tell you what song you are listening to on the same screen?  How dumb is that?  Very dissapointed in the product and will be returned.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 9, 2017|Pretty much the same as an echo or a DOT not many video skills|Its... ok... I think as more features come in to play it will be better not many of the skills are designed around the video screen right now
B01J24C0TI|2.0|2|July 13, 2017|Two Stars|too manu bugs, unable to connect via calls and message with other echo show and echo dot contacts.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 21, 2017|Not a fan of the show. At. All.|I love the echo family...I have a dot or an original echo in just about every room (even the bathrooms). I use echoes to control all of my lights, TVs, thermostats, etc. However, the show is just not a device that seems ready to me. So where do I begin? Well, I will just list some of the issues: Visual privacy, drop in is optional, but not welcome Speaker isn't good, the dots have better speakers Even at max, volume is still too low No 360 sound, you have to be in front of the device to often hear the response Bland/lifeless visuals, not a great touch interface Design is not very attractive - it's really bulky for what it is and if it were beige, it would easily be straight out of 1983 This show is getting returned.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 22, 2017|Work in progress, hoping it gets better|Needs more integrations and it needs to work better.  For example, I cannot seem to find a simple command for Echo to tell me what my Honeywell thermostat is set to,  I can change it up and down, it just won't report the current setting.  Also I have Shows in multiple homes, need a better way to delineate which devices go with which location.  For example, when in location "1" and I want to change the temperature, it should default to the thermostat co=located with the Show device I am speaking to.  Then it could require more specific instructions if I want to change the thermostat in the other location. Also, integration with Ring cameras is sporadic at best.  Sometime it shows them, sometimes it doesn't, even when the Ring App itself is able to show them. In addition, I would expect to be able to have more customization available for the Home Screen such as showing the current date along with weather conditions and forecast.  It is a "Show". It's a lot of money to spend for an alarm clock and shopping list manager.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|3|July 5, 2017|Meh.|As a regular echo it works fine.  I only have one so I have no idea how video/intercom work.  There doesn't seem to be much to do with the screen.  This is probably perfect for the kitchen.  What ruins it, though, is that there is no way to turn off the annoying suggestions that appear endlessly.  Seriously?  It is like a running ad (Try "Alexa, find albums by Billy Joel").  Does Billy get a cut from this crap?  I bought it mainly to keep up with technology and this does nothing for me.  I am sure there will be improvements in time.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|4|August 12, 2017|Was not ready for release|I think this should have gone through a lot more development before release. I feel I speak clearly, Alexa has serious problems understanding my requests and since it is not a tabllet with apps, voice communication is the only way to access it. Still no Netflix. If you pause during a movie or YouTube it goes back to home screen after a very short period of time and when I request resume it says it does not have that function. Picture quality and sound are good. I am just disappointed with its usefulness.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|13|July 2, 2017|Still in beta - needs more work|I love my Echos and thought the Echo Show would make a great kitchen companion. Unfortunately, it has one tragic flaw that needs to be addressed. The Echo Show will always revert back to its home screen, regardless of what you want. Want to set multiple cooking timers and keep them on screen for a quick glance? Sorry, it's going back to news headlines, calendar items, and the occasional timer reminder. How about that complicated recipe you are cooking from AllRecipes.com? Sorry, but the Echo Show is going to time out after a minute and you'll need to search for that recipe all over again. Need to pause that YouTube instructional video so you can duplicate the steps? Don't keep it paused too long or you are going back to the home screen.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|July 31, 2017|Nice device, terrible privacy implementation|While the system seems to work pretty well, and it's cool to use, there are two huge flaws related to calling -- which is the main reason to get an Echo Show over an audio-only model.  First, Alexa forces you to upload your *entire* contact list even if you have no intention of calling many of these people via Alexa.  Why does Amazon need to know everyone I've ever spoken with when all I want is a video chat with the grandparents?  Abysmal sensitivity to privacy. Second, Alexa rings all devices simultaneously that are linked to the same phone number.  Leaving aside that a device that sits in my kitchen shouldn't even require a mobile number to function, if my kids want to call their grandparents' Echo Show, it's not good for that to also ring my father's phone (usually while he's at work).  Why not allow calling only to the Show?  I find it inconceivable Amazon left out such basically functionality. At least Amazon finally added contact blocking, but even that initial lapse showed a stunning lack of attention to basic privacy and functionality.  Would not recommend until Amazon begins to take these things more seriously.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|0|July 4, 2017|One nice feature that could have been added as including a ...|Lousy design from base perspective. Expect this to be more than just video calling, Since video is introduced I pd hawas expecting to use as a in-home security device too, in addition to just video call. With the addition of video, One nice feature that could have been added as including a real time character that can speak to users like choose your favorite star as a face and that face could be pictured to the agent to speak to you, so you can feel it as a real time conversation. Also, another feature that could have been added is, based on the history of all the search a user has done, can alexa start a conversation with the user when needed, something like I was searching for a product and I would like to know when it becomes available, instead of an email, Alexa starting a conversation would be better too..
B01J24C0TI|2.0|5|July 7, 2017|👎🏾|As of today the album that played for me for a month will no longer play. It just ask some dumb questions whenever I request. I'm Pissed off now!😡😡 It does resume lol Update 7/21/17 I have to remove 2 stars because there are so many things this new $229 Plus tax item cant do- Pause fast forward, rewind next just to name a few & the $49 dot does all this plus more. I spent too much $ just for a screen I received this about 30 minutes ago😊 Setup took about 15 minutes or less looks great on my kitchen counter. Responsiveness is very good. Every command works well & sound and video is superb. I have 2 dots 1 echo & now the show😄
B01J24C0TI|2.0|1|September 16, 2017|Doesn't "listen" as well as Echo|I have used the Echo since it was launched and thought it was a great product.  When the Show was released, I wanted to upgrade.  The video, sound and all is good but I have to repeat myself twice as much as with the Echo.  I am not sure if the microphone array is different but it is not nearly as responsive.  I would not recommend at this time.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|7|July 2, 2017|Meh... I think I prefer the original...|I have to say I think I prefer the original.  I find the Echo Show to be intrusive, in that the screen is always scrolling some sort of nonsense that I have no interest in. I feel like I'm being spammed all day with the "tips" and any news on the screen always requires you to ask Alexa for more info. It would be a much better product if Amazon would allow you to set the home screen to just display time and temperature.  Hopefully they will give us the opportunity to set the home screen as we like-right now that's not an option.  I can see me unplugging the Echo Show and giving it away and going back to the original if we can't configure the device to our own preferences.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|8|June 30, 2017|It was easy to set up|It was easy to set up.  The main problems I have with it are the software - you cannot change or choose the information on the screen (so for example if I just want to display time and weather - I cannot do that - there is stupid stuff at the bottom like "try X..." that cannot be erased or hidden.) It is complicated to figure out how to change or delete "cards" and how to stop the screen from constantly changing (and some of the text will keep changing all day no matter what - no way to turn it off).  I tried playing youtube videos on it - and it does ultimately work - but it is so convoluted and frustrating on how to get the video you want - that I will probably not bother.  It is not fully formed yet and I found it frustrating unless you just want to listen to amazon music. Update - after using it for almost a week - I took it down and went back to my dot. I have an echo and two dots set up and I love them. The show does not seem to pick up as well on voice recognition, the speakers are not very good, getting it to play what you want on video is a frustrating chore, and dealing with the home or calendar screen is a hassle. I hope most of these problems are fixable - but at this point - I prefer the dot/echo.
B01J24C0TI|2.0|0|July 17, 2017|What Am I Missing|What am I missing?  I've only had my Echo Show for a few days but I'm completely underwhelmed.  The calendar function seems to be lacking in that you can't put an end day of an appointment.  And when asked to remove all appointments for a particular day, I'm prompted to scroll down, then get a message "something went wrong."  I wanted this for calendar and scheduling and so far, it gets an F.  Neat getting delivery notices on Amazon products but nothing is updated when delivered.  Only amazon products are tracked.  So far I feel like it's just a running of jeopardy type questions (no,I didn't pay $228 to find out what the mass of the moon is and no, I don't want to play a jazz list).  Capabilities seem limited unless you have your entire house installed with Echo devices that can be controlled (I'm not paying several hundred to get an Echo friendly thermostat).

The screen just went black and would not turn on. They sent me a replacement chord and it still had teh same issues. I liked it a lot and am hoping the gift will not have the same problem. For the cost of the device I really did not want to go through the customer service calls or the issue of returning and waiting for a replacement. In true Amazon fashion they made it as easy and as quick as possible to do the return.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|July 12, 2017|Overall very good, however I can't get calling features to work|Overall very good, however I can't get calling features to work. Wish there was someone who could walk me through these features

B01J24C0TI|3.0|2|July 15, 2017|The screen does not add to the experience as I hoped it would|Meh.  The screen really doesn't add much to the experience right out of the box.  You cant play any youtube videos as an example or google search anything (I.E use as a browser of sorts).  I knew this ahead of time but based on the video amazon used to advertise this I was under the impression it would be more useful than it actually is. You cannot just ask alexa to find a video on "XYZ".  If she was connected to youtube she'd be able to! I hope amazon finds more intuitive ways to use the screen when interacting with Alexa.  At the moment, for the price, buy the echo or like 4 echo dots
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|August 26, 2017|Will freeze up alot and have to be restarted.|It may be worth waiting to buy until the bugs are worked out. It works great however it will freeze up and have to be restarted several times. This usually happens when you don't talk to it daily.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|July 12, 2017|High hopes|It's OK for the initial rollout and I look forward to improvements over the next year or so. For some reason it won't play all of the movies or tv shows included with Prime that I can play on other devices. Sound quality is OK but I Bluetooth it to my Bose Soundlink Mini.  Adjusting settings with the touchscreen could use some improvement.

However the screen information feeds need improvement. The drop-in auto answer function is a privacy concern.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|1|July 11, 2017|Buy if you want a basic Alexa with Video Chat.|Pros: + Nice display + Decent speakers. Cons: - No aux out, can't integrate with my existing speaker system - clickbait-liike articles scroll all day. These got SUPER annoying. - a lot of missed potential in the default settings. For example, headline was "new haircut everywhere at paris fashion week. for more say alexa tell me about fashion week haircut" but the scrolling article never shows the actual haircut.... My home is already outfitted with good speakers, Sonos, and Echo Dots. Unless you're buying this for the video chat/alexa feature, wait for V2.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|1|July 12, 2017|Good, not great.|So far it appears to do everything a regular echo does. Can't say I'm blown away or anything. One issue I experienced was when asking the 2017 MLB All-Star game score, and it couldn't verbally tell me. But in screen it showed it was 1-1 in the 9th. I asked my Google home, and it knew without issue. That said, I'll update my review when the "show" features appear to be worth the price tag. If this was $100 less I'd have given a 5 star rating out of the gate.

B01J24C0TI|3.0|2|July 4, 2017|Good, but needs some tweaks by Amazon to be great|This is a great upgrade from the original Echo, however, there are a couple annoyances and lost opportunities that I hope will be addressed in software updates. First, rotating suggestions about how you can use Echo appear on the screen. They even appear while the Show is doing other things, like on the "now playing" screen while playing music. There is a setting to control them, but you can't get rid of them completely. They are very distracting and unnecessary for some people, and I wish you could turn them off. Next, I'm not convinced that the sound is as good as the original, and there is no way to control the speaker bass or treble. Lastly, there is no option to display a simple monthly calendar on the screen. These are issues that I'm sure Amazon can address, and overall I am enjoying the Show, and it is definitely worth the extra cost over the Echo.

Sound is pretty unidirectional and the bass sounds like it's coming out of a box. The Show could be slicker looking. Looks like a small projection TV. I own many Echo products and love them but I think this was a little rushed. Hopefully the video conferencing works good. Going to give one to my family in Chicago.

I could not listen to certain iHeart stations (the ones I wanted to listen to) or any of my podcast. So it was pretty much pointless for me.

B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|July 12, 2017|I was expecting more.|Having a screen is nice, but the Echo technology is ahead of the Intranet. Alexa can't answer many pretty simple questions.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|6|June 30, 2017|Promising but SLOW|The new Echo Show joined our household in the kitchen replacing the original Echo and supplementing an Echo Dot. The Show is a promising device, and will serve as a center of quick information in the center for the family. For example, we have started displaying the family calendar for quick reference, and the kids (9 and 12) enjoy listening to music while seeing the lyrics on the display. My son is also using the Show to watch some videos in the kitchen instead of retrieving away. We also like to use the Show to display recipes. We found the Alexa very slow compared to the Dot and Original connected to the same Wi-Fi network so we can only assume the slow response is due to the device and not the network. When we ask Alexa to take an action, there is a good time of silence before Alexa responds. There is also a break between each songs - a much longer duration than we have seen with the Dot or the original. The kids calls this Alexa the Stupid one... We hope this will be fixed with a software upgrade very soon.

B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|August 18, 2017|Cool alarm clock|Alexa is great when asked for sports scores, weather, jokes, and music. Is also great as an alarm clock. She will frequently answer "I don't know". Her voice frequently cuts out.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|July 12, 2017|Doesn't do as much as I thought it would.|I thought it would do more. Wanted it to show me a map to  restaurants,  and maps to local tourist attractions. It would be helpful if it had apps.

B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|August 8, 2017|Three Stars|It's a good product but not as loud in volume as the echo.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|July 26, 2017|Needs fixes|The stand needs to be flexible, move up and down,  turn side to side.  The screen is small, could be larger.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|July 22, 2017|Sonos and Alexa woukd be a perfect match| It's a pretty sweet device. What I think will earn her five stars will be her ability to work with Sonos wifi speakers.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|July 12, 2017|It's OK.|I thought that it would intact better with some of my home automation.  I had it outside by my pool for streaming and it overheated and stopped working.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|August 25, 2017|For now it's being utilized much like my other echo form factors|Not sure really how to take advantage of the screen. For now it's being utilized much like my other echo form factors, I have a dot and a tall echo.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|September 19, 2017|Three Stars|Nice I like it
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|July 29, 2017|Great product and very easy to use for simple tasks|Great product and very easy to use for simple tasks. Radio, timers, lists. However you tube and looking topics up on the internet is a little clunky and could use some tweaking to improve. Have had many failures looking items up on the internet.
B01J24C0TI|3.0|0|September 15, 2017|Still not functional for the elderly.|As many of the Voice Activated Personal Assistants (VAPA's) I've tested, it is still not functional as an actual daily aid to people needing help. So far, it's a good "trick" or novelty item. It needs time and real science to make it usable for am elder or senior trying to optimize aging at home with the aid of VAPA's.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 22, 2017|BOSS|Every thing about is fantastic, the UI, the screen, the shape, the size, the power cord is well hidden, and she basically does everything you would expect from a Echo Device but now with a screen! One thing I really enjoy is how quick and responsive the skype calling is! One thing I can't figure out is for the Echo Show to tell me the weather in Degrees Fahrenheit?! It's stuck!
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|We did not understand that she had to have a Smart phone in order to make calls--and apparently two different ...|Bought a second Show so that I might communicate with my sister in Illinois.  We did not understand that she had to have a Smart phone in order to make calls--and apparently two different Amazon techs told her this.  This entailed her having to buy a phone she did not want and extra expense.  Had this been pointed out to her we would have just stuck with the Dot we originally sent her for this past Christmas.  Because of our "gift" she had to buy a phone and now has expensive monthly bills.  Wish I had not bought it!
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Echo Show - nice additional to Alexa family|Mostly very positive experience.  Negative - even if you turn off all background screen notices, you cannot get rid of 'Try this' message at bottom of screen & it cuts off the background pics you'd like to enjoy. Easy setup like my Echo & Dot.  Loading pictures into Amazon Prime Photos & Amazon Drive not intuitive.  What I loaded into Photos overwrites Photos, so this took hours to setup correctly.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Great Hardware But More Work is Needed on the Software|I like the hardware but I think the Software needs some more work & improvements. For example, trying to call a particular echo device from my Android App causes ALL Echos on the account to ring. It would also be nice if I could control the size and placement of my local video image while in a video call.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|August 24, 2017|Great idea. Some documentation would have been nice and ...|Great idea. Some documentation would have been nice and save a lot of time. The Show also drops WIFI occasionally, even when the other devices in the house are ok, even farther away devices. Once I figured out all the ins and outs and it holds WIFI it is an amazing piece of hardware.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|1|July 5, 2017|Almost there|Basic. Alexa with a screen. Bough additional items for. My children ( and grandchildren). They haven't set up their app yet. Like prime movies and you tube connectity.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Love it, but no two way audio|I really like the Show. It adds a nice visual aid to my home automation. The sound is better than Echo. I really bought them (2) for displaying Nest Cams on demand without using my phone. Would get easily 5 stars but the video skill is missing one important feature - no two way audio.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 26, 2017|A fun assistant|Very fun.  She sings and raps if you want her too.  She is not an "information" center, rather an assistant.  Sets timers, make lists, etc. I have not connected it to smart home equipment yet.  Love having a selection for music but very expensive monthly.  Wish it could answer questions (like Google).
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 13, 2017|I love it so far|I love it so far.  My one issue and the reason why I gave it 4 stars, is that sometimes the Show doesn't hear the code word Alexa when I am right up on the device.  I hope this is a software issue and not a hardware issue.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|August 24, 2017|Getting better all the time.|Not perfect but still fun to use.  There is so much I want this thing to do that it does not do currently... but it keeps getting better all the time and no other device comes close.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 8, 2017|I love it, BUT|I love it but every night the brightness dims all the way down even though the ambient light switch is off.  Every night it just dims all the way down for no reason.  Other than that, it is great.  Just hard to see it at night.

I wish it could display the clock bigger when not interacting, but I wish I could adjust the tilt for the camera. The good thing is the possibilities it holds for the future without having to buy a new model. Thank you Amazon for not following the Apple model. It is appreciated!
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 13, 2017|I do like it, but it seriously needs more apps to ...|I do like it, but it seriously needs more apps to integrate into the home automation system. Like a door bell camera that shows on the screen would be great.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|August 31, 2017|Alexa is my new favorite electronic.|I have been waiting for this all my life.  I can listen to music all day long.  I can listen to a book.  Having information for recipes within my eyesight in the kitchen is wonderful.  The grandkids are going to love using this to find out how many stars are there in the sky and how to make play dough and what do I need to know to run track.  The possibilities are endless.  My only critique is that it doesn't allow me to set the alarm to wake me up every morning. I have to tell it every night to wake me up.  If I could set my alarm to wake me up M-F @ 7 am that would be a 5 star moment.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|August 19, 2017|it very cool to show arlo cameras on this thing|it very cool to show arlo cameras on this thing.  i have a problem with drop in feature.  some of my dots show unavailable and i cant drop in. i hope they add playing music on all echo devices at one time play the same song in sync.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 9, 2017|AI life is getting there :)|Echo Show is awsome still needs a little work and could use some more uses but other then that this thing makes life easier alot more fun Once you get a hue bulb your wallet will be empty haha :) hope this helps
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 28, 2017|Very good - potential to be great with software updates.|Has the potential to be great!  Pretty good right now. Voice by itself can only do so much, a picture is worth a thousand words.  The combination will likely be the best mid term solution until VR / AR comes along. Industrial design is not going to impress, and certainly not anything like Apple quality - but it gets the job done and with future updates I expect this to be a long term winner.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Its pretty much like the Echo except with a screen|Its pretty much like the Echo except with a screen. I like the visual ability to see your schedule and the little suggestions. My only thing is the music quality sounds muffled.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 4, 2017|Mixed opinions|I like the new show, but wish it had a larger screen or a port to attach to a tv screen. I also think the flash briefing should come with more video footage Rather than some of them just saying the new channel name. I think they should also contract with sling, Netflix or Hulu so you can also watch additional shows other than just what is on prime. Other wise we are happy with ours. I do think the price is a little high for what it is.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|August 15, 2017|Quality Show!|The Show has good sound quality. The interface is sometimes puzzling in trying to figure how to accomplish specific tasks, for example after pausing a prime video and going to the home screen, it isn't necessarily intuitive how to return to the video. Maybe an icon of what is active could appear when paused. I'm sure more capabilities are in the works.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Great|Love screen....little disappointed in some of the content. Weather, music, etc. great. So need Amazon Music 3.99 month to get all songs

B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|learning the Echo Show|Love love the sound quality,  did not expect it to be as large as it is.  Haven't spent much time using it but that will change in the future.  At that point I will let you know.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|1|July 12, 2017|Get your  friends  and family  connected.|Worked  great with phone connection.  Still learning  of many other things sure as music.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 30, 2017|Broken Echo Nest Integration (Be Careful) - Disappointed with Customer Service| I am a huge fan of the echo devices and have multiple in the house. However was very disappointed at how customer service handled a issue that is genuinely in Amazon's best interest to resolve as quickly as possible. Amazon needs to be take notice and fix a major flaw in their integration with Nest before it breaks down a few A/C units. Video show the Nest thermostat being set to 50 degrees incorrectly.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|August 8, 2017|Good addition to alexa family.|Great new way to enjoy alexa. Still has some problems. I bought this thinking I can view my ezviz cameras . no way still trying . have to call support email was no help. I do feel all will work out. I will update when I find out more.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 26, 2017|Well Designed|Not fully functional yet, but the design is perfect. I asked it to play a video, and it played something I liked. Amazing. Would recieve five stars if it played well with other devices and had just a little more customization options. I should be able to fully setup anything without having to bring out my phone. This has a screen...
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 22, 2017|Looks a little dated but we are very happy with it|We like it very much so far it's been our expectations we kind of wish it was a little more of a modern design it seems a little bulky and clunky but other than that it is a nice device and seems to work well
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Good|Yes for most part it has met my expectations, except I would like to download my videos and music from iTunes. Also like to see my email.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Great product, the angle needs work.|Echo does a very good job at just about everything you ask. I rated it four stars because it's the weird angle the camera has. I had to put something behind it to prop for good video while the kids chat with the grandparents.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 31, 2017|Great improvement|All in all the echo show does what’s advertised. And I looks good while doing it. I find some difficulty searching you tube and would love to be able to just push things to the screen like you can do with Apple TV and chrome cast. A little more explanation of what all this can do would be great. I upgraded from an original echo first gen so this is quite an improvement
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 22, 2017|Very nice up grade!|This is certainly an upgade from the first round of echo products! Amazon could improve things a bit with a suggested list of commands that will work from the get go but, otherwise easy to set up and use. The drop in feature, now in the sotware, is good but not great as, I may be wrong on this, you may not refuse a drop in by using a verbal command. At least I have not found a way yet and, if there is a way, my problem could have been solved with a written manual...which does not exist except on line.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|August 25, 2017|Will buy again!!|Really enjoy the Echo Show....Some times has problems understanding me but that is just a process!  Convenient and it is great when you ask for a phone number and it shows it...Don't have to remember it.  Love to see the lyrics of a song too! No more peanut butter an flour on my phone or ipad keyboard either as it shows me a recipe and doesn't time out.  I would buy again and would definitely recommend it! I do not have a dot or other echo but love the Show and may just get another!!

The Show provides about half the functionality as the Dash right now, but has a lot of promise as it evolves -- especially when linked with other Echo devices.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Def nice to be able to see things instead of just ...|It does what is advertised.  Def nice to be able to see things instead of just hearing them...weather, music to choose from, movies/vids to choose from, etc.  Still needs more choices and also ways to connect to other Amazon devices like Fire TV and such.  Hope they keep adding more things to it as will def get more going forward...and if price goes down a bit too of course, lol.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|FUN|Having fun learning what she will and won't do. I was led to believe that I could connect to my Netflix but apparently I cannot do that yet. Otherwise i am pleased.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|1|July 13, 2017|Hoping for better sound|It works as advertised too.  I was hoping the speaker would be better,  it is slightly less robust than the original echo. At least that is my opinion having both and 4 echo dots.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 23, 2017|Neat idea!|So far, so good.  Nice to have visual feedback for weather and other answers. Fun to see lyrics of songs that are playing. Just like the other Echo products, I'm sure it will take time to learn all the capabilities this device has to offer.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|The Good & the Bad|The Good - Great screen, nice visuals and still does everything an Echo has in the past and more. The Bad - I feel a bit of bait & switch here because some of its coolest features like displaying song lyrics or even something as simple as having a folder of wallpapers on shuffle are for Prime Members only. I feel that if you are not a Prime Member, you only get to enjoy about 1/2 of what the device can do. I wish more of the "good stuff" were available to everyone who shelled out $225 for the device and not just for those who continue to give Amazon money monthly.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Reaction is fast voice recognition is great even across the room|Reaction is fast voice recognition is great even across the room. However why too many "skills"  for my family to learn how to operate the alexia. Especially prime music and video. I am still learning
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|September 19, 2017|I love tech toys and this one is fun|I love tech toys and this one is fun.  I would like Alexa to be a little more interactive.  Im sure the programmers are working hard on her updates so that some day she can carry on a conversation.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 22, 2017|Cool device, waiting for more skills.|Neat device. Way better than rev1. Still limited in skills, would love to see a lot more development in the skills that it can do. Right now not sure it's a $230 device, but I'm an early adopter.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 19, 2017|Very cool!|I am an electronic gadget junky, so I bought this without really knowing what I was getting.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!!  I'm still learning all the things Alexa can do for me, and I love it!
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|This is really a great addition to the Echo line|This is really a great addition to the Echo line, but just like the Dot, being a first day adopter has burned us. My major decision point was the demo, pre sales video showing Ring integration which has recently been announced is not fully supported. Overall though I love it. The sound is awesome!!
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|August 7, 2017|It had good reviews so i opted for the show|I originally wanted to purchase just a standard echo, but then did alittle  research on the echo show. It had good reviews so i opted for the show. Over all it's been pretty good. Still learning what all it can do. Not overly impressed with the speakers. I've listened the standard echo and it would appear that the speakers in the standard echo sound better. I would recommend the show in general. Not sure if additional speakers can be added.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Cool device|Cool device.  It does everything that Echo can do.  The advantage is the display.  You can show movies, photos, and videos on it.  While playing songs, it shows the lyrics.  When on, the display shows your calendar, and news, etc.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Nice upgrade|I enjoy it.great upgrade from Alexa.my small gripe is when I'm speaking to someone on the other end of the show when I said Alexa it activates the commands.need more names seeing that I have multiple devices in my house. Can't say anything else because I'm still getting use to it. But I do love the device especially it's compatible with my ring system.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 12, 2017|Everything about this device is speculator. Only reason it ...|Everything about this device is speculator. Only reason it gets just 4 stars is the angle of the camera. It points up too high for proper facial capture. Otherwise it is a KILLER!
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 22, 2017|Good but can be better.|Works good and does more than I thought it would. However the original Alexa has better sound and noise blanker that the Show doesn't have.
B01J24C0TI|4.0|0|July 10, 2017|Waiting for further software improvement|Good product but still required further improvement on software / OS. Integration to Smartthings, WEMO, and Logitech Harmony are fine. Bass of the speaker is a bit too heavy, but fair. For using in non-US area, functions related to traffic, map and location can't be properly located and used.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 21, 2017|Love love love.|Our other echo went out and we had to have another one. Decided to spend the extra money for the Echo Show. Well worth it. We already have cameras hooked up through the show and the screen makes the whole Alexa experience even better. Takes things to the next level. Really awesome.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 24, 2017|Love the Show|This took the place of a "regular" Echo in our kitchen. So far this has done everything the Echo did, plus you get the bonus of a screen to provide you info. Timers are easier, recipes are available, lyrics are visible for songs and you can stream Amazon movies, etc - what more could you ask for?
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|September 16, 2017|We absolutely love our Alexa Show|We absolutely love our Alexa Show.  If you have kids, here's all you need to hear:  Rather than answer the door, the kids just walk up to the Show and tell her, "Alexa show me the front door.."  They don't need to go to the door.  No one can tell they are home.  (Note:  You need an arlo camera system for this.)  They also love the karaoke style of presenting songs with lyrics.  Everything else is incidental.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|3|July 10, 2017|Waited years to buy an Echo and the Echo Show is TERRIFIC!!!|I waited to buy an Echo for the last couple of years and the Echo Show has exceeded my expectations. You will not be dissapoinred with this devices capabilities!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 15, 2017|90 yr old says he likes it|Bought it to keep in contact with 90 yr old father. Had relatives help set it up and have been using it for about a week - just video chats.  90 yr old likes it and so far has not had any problems using it, but we have not introduced any of the extra features as it may get too confusing for a guy who is not techno savvy.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 12, 2017|The Echo Show is cool for a tech filled house|I really like the Echo Show so far. I wish the screen was a little bit bigger, but not a big deal. I like that I can view my Arlo security cameras, really, really helpful. Pulling youtube videos is a cool feature. And accessing my photos is also really cool. A friend a I bought 2 and saved 100$ and that made us happy. Overall I am very pleased with the Echo Show. My fave feature at this point is the fact that I can access my Arlo security cameras, as stated above.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|September 6, 2017|Cool Product|Love my Echo show.  I have it in the bedroom and use it to set reminders, turn on/off lights, and to view my security cameras when they pick up detection.  It still has a way to go in being able to answer questions correctly, but overall, it's a cool product to have.  The only issues that I have had is when Alexa commercials come on the television and the Echo Show picks up the keyword.  lol
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 22, 2017|Thank you Amazon!!!! Echo Show far exceeds my expectations every day!!!|I thought Kindle was the next evolution. I was wrong, this is the most intuitive device Amazon has developed. You'll begin learning how to use it from the moment you unpackage the device. Have trouble with technology? No worries, as Echo Show will help you along and tell you how to ask what you're looking for. Prime Music, shopping, local weather, news, audio books, videos, etc. etc. etc. - Take the chance, you won't regret a minute you spend with this beauty.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 12, 2017|Too much fun so far...|I've only had it a short time but I'm having a ball with this thing.  I bought two and sent one to my 83 year old mother so can call and see us when ever she feels like it. The skills are easy to install, if not easy to find.  I believe the interface for finding skills could be improved but that's really just a minor issue.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 24, 2017|Eye of the Storm|This sleek device was essential this weekend.  My wife and I recently acquired a beach house.  Not only did it prove to be the center of conversation with a number of family and friends but having a screen to watch Amazon Prime Movies kept the two kids entertained as we haven't had an opportunity to get a TV.  When the children weren't watching; the adults had as much fun pumping the tunes (mostly reggae and beach themed music). As a side note suggested to a brother-in-law that our mother-in-law could benefit from an Echo as her fingers are gnarled with rheumatoid arthritis.  Being able to call out "call Donna" would provide a semblance of control and connection. Now I'm getting familiar with using the Show to slideshow pictures via Amazon Drive Storage.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 23, 2017|Alexa on steroids!|Okay, since getting this, we haven't turn on our Echo again, we love having this in the kitchen. Playing music, videos for the kids, seeing the time and temp clearly. It's great! Sounds great when playing music, I do with the screen was slightly bigger, but for now, this is perfect!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 12, 2017|The "show" is just as wonderful as the Echo|❤️Alexa! The "show" is just as wonderful as the Echo, but now you can see what she's talking about: news, lists, lyrics, etc. plus, the calling feature now becomes a video call or drop-in. I'd like to have more options for the home screen, but I'm sure they'll add to the features over time, just as they have been doing to the echo all along. :)
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 26, 2017|LOVE IT!!!!!!|I love how this has helped automate my home. I also love that it get smarter every day and learn us more so we do not have to repeat ourselves. I also love how my 3 grandsons 600 miles away can easily call me and see me any time they want without their parents having to open a program or hold a phone for them.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 19, 2017|Best Echo Yet!|These are the best Echo's yet!  I finally bought six of them and gave one to my son.  The others are distributed around my house.  I recommend this version of the echo over the others if you are only getting one however the Echo dot is fantastic when connected to a high end stereo system.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|3|July 7, 2017|I like it, however I have not been able to ...|I like it, however I have not been able to enable to my contacts or message or make telephone calls, very disappointed, any help you can provide will be highly appreciated.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|3|July 2, 2017|I love it!|I love it!!  Because I'm so completely and enthusiastically satisfied with the Echo Dot, I pre-ordered the Show and have had it for 3 days now.  Installation was a snap and it connected itself to the Alexa app automatically.  I'm sure I'll find a zillion uses for it -- so far, I think it's great to be able to actually see my shopping list on the screen and I guess I just like "seeing" (as opposed to hearing) the weather, the name (amd lyrics) of the song that's playing and other things.  I just happened to find out about the "messaging" feature on Echo today and it works perfectly on this and the Dot.  I must say, I'm especially excited about having cameras at the front and back doors -- I've got two cameras on their way to me.  Once I have it all checked out and am using all the things it can do, I'll buy them for my grown nieces so they can talk to each other while they're making dinner (or whatever) in different towns.  Amazon does everything so extremely well and this is easily up to the very high standard they've created and we've all come to expect.  The Show is nice and heavy, so it's not going to be knocked off the table.  In that I happen to sit right here beside it a lot of the time, I'd like to be able to make the rolling prompts (for videos, etc) stop and let the screen just be dark -- sure as shootin' there's a setting or command for that, so I'm unconcerned.  Yes indeed, I love the Show!!!  I have to believe you will, too!!!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 2, 2017|If you own echo products, a must addition|I love this product so far.  Screen quality is very good.  Sound quality is very good.  If you enjoy echo products then you will like this.  Video chatting is great and more convenient than on my phone.  I have one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom which I use as my alarm clock and more.  Thinking of getting one more for my office at work.  I also own an echo dot which for the price it is a great product as well.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|5|July 3, 2017|I'm Loving' it!| I'm so glad that Amazon released this! Now Alexa will not just tell you what's happening, she will show you. I have one in my kitchen and my home office plus I plan on purchasing 2 more. My 2 most favorite features right now is that I have lyrics on the screen while listening to some of my favorite songs!! I'm dangerous now! LOL  Another thing I love is that it connects to my RING camera so I can monitor the outside of my house. I'm very happy with my purchase!.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 13, 2017|Echo, Tap, Dot, Show...have them all.|Just keeps getting better and better...buy 2 and save $100. A desktop clock that does apointments, reminders, plays  music, videos, news and is a security camera to boot. Just arrived today...will update when I get home All the negatives be quite...the Echo  got crapped on in the begining and look at it now.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|11|June 30, 2017|Exceeds my expectations|Many professional reviewers have come up a little short on this unit indicating it's not enough of this or too much of that. However, I don't see any of the indicated shortcomings as real. I think this is terrific, a great improvement over the tubular Echo. The display in combination with the Echo technology really brings it to another level of usefulness  Very excited to see what skills/apps will take advantage of this device moving forward. The Echo Show has raised the bar.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 20, 2017|Staying Connected Takes Another Step Further!|The Echo Show is great.  I had a couple of the Echo devices previously and really liked them so decided to try the Echo Show.  The addition of the screen really takes Alexa to the next level.  The best feature of the Show is the video calling and texting.  We've started using this quite a bit.  The camera video quality is excellent.  I actually bought a Show for my parents and all 3 of my grown children.  If we can't stay connected this way, then we have no excuses! My next step is to hook up the Echo Show to an outdoor video system for the house along with a couple of Smart Home devices.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 21, 2017|Saves a LOT of time when working out with a partner!!!! No need for long drives anymore!!|Using it for workouts with my bff and it works great!! We can workout together but don't have the long drive to each others house which saves us a ton of time, trying to get together for workouts after work. Also is great for face to face hands free conversations, of course. :-) Had no issues with it so far. So  - no complaints :-)
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 6, 2017|Exited About the Future of this Product.|Found it more far more useful than expected. Bought 2, and can use as a visual intercom via the drop in feature.  Lock my self out of the house and used the amazon app on phone to drop in and get the family's attention inside (drop in on phone app works from on celluar data also).  Play mostly kids songs, kids videos, flash video briefings, audiobooks.  Finding very useful in daily life.  Found "hidden" setting by swiping from top very useful.  Also find annoying to always turn, thinking of buying some kind of lazy Susan turntable (probably should have been built in). FInal thought -  wish bigger.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 31, 2017|My Favorite!|I find the Echo Show to be such a delight ! And I'm just scratching the surface of all that it will do. Some day, when I have a spare day, I'd like to wear  Alexa out with requests. I even enjoy when she goofs up (speaks when not spoken to). She sings quite well too! I have tons of gadgets and the Echo  Show is by far my favorite.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|2|July 9, 2017|Nice addition to my security|So far everything seems to be fine I'm starting just to enjoy it
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|September 19, 2017|Everyone Should Have One!|OMG! I love this thing!! I got it as a gift from my sister. I already had an Echo Dot, which I love as well!  The "Show" is like a whole new level of cool! We just went thru Hurricane Irma and I was saying the two things I missed the most was AC and Alexa. Everyone should have one of these!!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 12, 2017|better then apple pie|more then my best hopes.  i bought two , i am a senior  the pair enable me to feel secure allows me to see front door, included  allows me to see front room , the sound is great., the drop in call provide me the ability to make hands free calls. i chat with my granddaughter in college  face to face. i am learning new things every day
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 16, 2017|Family Calendars, Video Chats, Weather!!  Alexa has gone to college/ charm school.|As Sony dropped support for our Dash boxes, this product came along at the perfect time.  New feature being discovered almost daily.  Love the fact you can video chat from iPhone to Show.  Easy to manage family Google calendar.  Can see Arlo video cameras.  Excited about the future potential add ons.  Wish it had an audio or hdmi output.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|1|July 14, 2017|First Echo. Super pumped for an assistant :)|First Echo product and I am very pleased. I had an issues with getting all of the "Skills" to work but after some research I had purchased the Echo with my second Amazon account and had the app setup with my main account. The resolution was to "deregister" the Echo on my second account and then register it onto my main account. Other then that small issues the Echo Show is amazing! I should have used that introduction sale for 2 Shows for $100 discount.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 14, 2017|We love The Echo Show|We love The Echo Show! Our granddaughters were moving away so we bought 2 and sent one with them. Being able to have them call us and see their sweet little faces is a major plus. It does every once in awhile spout out something when no one is near, but we figured it out, It was a fruit fly that would land on the screen.It is kind of funny because I was talking in the back of the house and she says I have added Shower Bagels to your list. Over all i fantastic purchase
B01J24C0TI|5.0|1|July 9, 2017|Echo Show is a very innovative product. The technology ...|Echo Show is a very innovative product. The technology installed in the show is very advanced and it's adaptive capabilities are endless.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 30, 2017|Works fantastic for video calls between us|Purchased the two pack for our distant daughter and ourselves. Works fantastic for video calls between us. We also enjoy the video flash briefings and the ability to watch specific items on You Tube. It controls all of our lights on the main floor and our television as well. In my opinion the speakers sound better on the Show than on the Echo. Only wish it was battery accessable as well. Overall a great product.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 26, 2017|Quickly Replaced the Original Echo|I didn't think it would replace my cylinder shape Echo (the original).  It took only 2 days!  The screen is a great addition.  Show does the trick!  The original has a better sound, but Echo Show still sounds good (better than our Bose radio).  Seeing the song lyrics is really grand.  The original Echo was moved from the kitchen to my workroom in the garage.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|1|July 15, 2017|Love it.|What can I say? This is what I've been waiting for since Amazon first launched Echo. I'm so hooked I wish my house were bigger so I can put one in each room and pretend I live on the Starship Enterprise or something!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|1|July 12, 2017|Echo Show|Love the Echo Show, am discovering new things it can do everyday. Super easy to set up and I'm not that knowledgeable when it comes to electronic gadgetry! Just ask my kids! Very good quality.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|1|July 14, 2017|Thoroughly impressed|Everything i expected and much more. Bought it for my 8yr old daughter to use as a learning, entertainment and video calling device and it does all that as good as can possibly be done. I have the echo dot for myself but if i had the money i wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these for me. Too cool
B01J24C0TI|5.0|3|July 6, 2017|Love the Echo Show!|Not sure of everything this can do, but so far we all love it!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 26, 2017|The timers are fantastic in the kitchen and I love being able to ...|I am obsessed with Alexa.  She comes in handy as I walk around and realize I need to add something to the shopping list.  The timers are fantastic in the kitchen and I love being able to play music while I cook.  I also love hearing my morning briefing before I even climb out of bed.  The only thing I hated? When 8 college kids also became obsessed wither her and kept changing commands!  Also, hopefully we can rename her to the name of our choosing!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 24, 2017|Like it so far|I got this on release date to replace the echo in my kitchen. It gets use everyday weather it is for music, news, calendar, etc. I'm looking forward to see what all else amazon can do with the show. My favorite feature is the calendar. It is very easy to tell the show about an event you need to add. It will show this event many times as it cycles through different news headlines which is a great reminder for me.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 12, 2017|Fabulous device, our first Echo.|This is our first Echo. I'm bad at reading instructions so I started setting up basis prompts. Took maybe 2 minutes with no additional effort. The device did take time to load as it was downloading an update. Alexa started introducing the device and features. Here are skills that we use daily, timers: such ease, no need to poke around on your phone. YouTube trailers:Alexa shows a notification as soon as a new trailer comes out and immediately plays it if prompted. Music requires a little effort and needs clear enunciation when band or song names are similar to another.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 12, 2017|I love my Echo Show|I love my Echo Show. She is so much more informative and responsive to voice commands and the sound from the speakers is amazing. I love seeing my children and grandchildren when they call. I bought several of these so we can all stay in touch and see each other more often this way.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|3|July 7, 2017|love the experience with both voice and display|love the experience with both voice and display.  Use mainly for music and info but also control Lutron lighting and Honeywell HVAC.  Keep the skills coming.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|August 5, 2017|Fantastic|Bought this for my wife. We have the Echo, two Echo Dots and the Tap. This is installed  in the kitchen.  It does all the other function of the other devices but the screen works great for looking at cooking steps. You tube etc., Makes a nice screen saver background. It dims at night It,s best use is the ability to talk to someone having the same device and being able to see them. We havn't tried this yet.  Overall it,s a great addition to our system or as a stand alone unit. The size is perfect, about seven inches square.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 22, 2017|Echo show|We love this, still learning all it's features, the kids love asking Alexa for help with homework, youtube videos, and Alexa, guess the animal game, plus they think it's fun to call each other  from different rooms in the house, very "jetsons"! We (Mom and Dad) like the news and weather briefings, and playing jazz music, Christian music, or 50's music, depending on whether you're trying to relax, gain some energy, or missed church Sunday!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|September 19, 2017|Love it!|I purchased four Echo Shows: one for my parents, one for my in-laws, one for my son in the military, and one for me. They work great, and our elderly parents (in their 80s) are enjoying much more than video visits! They enjoy asking Alexa questions, playing music, watching videos, having her flip a coin, seeing our photographs. My mother is not well, and it's super helpful to be able to have an "in person" visit. The only hiccup was getting my dad to remember her name! A side benefit is that my dad speaks more clearly since he began using Alexa, and he loves singing along with the music she plays. My in-laws dance once in a while instead of watching TV.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|3|July 2, 2017|Well worth the market entry price|Awesome. Can't wait for even more skills. The addition of a screen makes echo ecosystem even more useful.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|3|July 3, 2017|Need mors live news or live broadcasts|So far so good Wish it did more live news rather than just flash news hopefully app
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 13, 2017|What a fun toy|Love the echo , mine you I have 33 devices that interacts or are controlled by the amazon show..the reason I added the show was to view my arlo cams on it , to see song lyrics while songs are playing cost me 3.99 a month .. I don't have prime and own a combo of 6 Alexa's. I don't need prime a co worker has it and I and about 10 other people give her 10 bucks a year... so she has free prime... anyway the show is AWSOME love that it plays movie trailers on point , love the video calling, not to mention the fun of controlling , lights, thermostat's , fans , dyson air purifier, locks, arlo cams, arlarm system  ect.. I'm like Captain Kirk and iron man around the house , so much fun!!! Even with having all this stuff I would be happy just owning a 50.00 echo dot , but if you can afford an echo show go get it , you won't be disappointed!!!!!
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 12, 2017|Echo Show-So far, So Good|So far it seems to function as the pre-release literature and publicity promised.  I have  not  had a great deal of time to fully  explore  the devices potential and possibilities, but I like what I have seen so far. Set up was very easy!  I like  the screen that provides visuals, and I Like the ability to set the device so ALexa can suggest things for you to try as you become more familiar  with it.  Being abLe to see song lyrics as the music plays is great.
B01J24C0TI|5.0|0|July 23, 2017|Just like the Jetsons!!!|I can't tell you how much we are enjoying our 3 Echo Shows.  My husband bought 2 of them for my birthday and we loved them so much we bought another one for the kitchen.  My grandchildren are visiting and I told "Alexa" to play a children's video and she played videos that the children loved. I ask her what my schedule is for the day and she names off all of my appointments/events.  We put one in our bedroom, one in the office and one in the kitchen.  The grandchildren will drop in on us in the office and kitchen.  We "hang out" together, even after we are done speaking to one another.
B01LRLJV28|1.0|0|February 15, 2017|Sony has Terrible service!!!!|Worked for two months for it started making a loud noise. Sent it for service and Sony refused to fix. Sony is notorious for having terrible service and I have experienced first hand. They are sending it back unrepaired and i am out of $249.00 dollars. Will try to take it up with Amazon to see what happnens

My years and years old never cleaned ps3 has never done that before. Very upset. Online it says I have to take the panel off and remove the HDD and take the disc out myself which would void any warranty. And I cant play any other discs. Don't buy the slim I guess, look up if the other has the same problem.

B01LRLJV28|1.0|2|December 20, 2016|Don't do the game update!|Once I did the update with the game...when the patch was downloaded the game would just get stuck at the opening and give no message. I tried everything a little disappointing considering the bundle was $249.00 The issue I believe is only with the game and the associated update.
B01LRLJV28|1.0|4|January 7, 2017|PS4 Slim severe overheating issues, shutting down.|I expected Sony quality for this, as I already have a PS3 and PS4 (original).  This unit overheated 10 mins after I powered up for the first time, while used horizontally (which is not as good for heat transfer).  I turned it on its side and it seemed to work fine.  Then I played Destiny for about 5 hrs, and it overheated again, mid-game.  This is a severe disappointment.  I am currently travelling on business and outside of the US, and I won't be able to return this for another 2 weeks, when I return home.
B01LRLJV28|1.0|11|December 28, 2016|One Star|I opened it up and uncharted was already opened and the game wasn't inside
B01LRLJV28|1.0|One|January 13, 2017|Wrapped PS4 box|I received the ps4 box damage. This makes me ask if the product is new or used. I'm really disappointed about it.
B01LRLJV28|1.0|2|January 15, 2017|Malfunctions constantly after only two-three weeks of use.|From week 2-3 the console would occasionally randomly lock up for several seconds when a game was running and shut off. A week later the PS4 would never awaken from rest mode, leaving only a flashing blue light on the button. I would always have to plug out the console and restart to use the machine. I tried different tips and solutions to these issues but none worked, so this is probably faulty hardware. These issues occurred almost daily.

B01LRLJV28|1.0|0|May 7, 2017|Wouldn't work|Bought this as a birthday present for my daughter a month ago and gave it to her last night.  We hooked it up per the instructions and it did not work at all.  Even unhooked it and rebooked it and still doesn't work!  Emailed customer service to refund my money back so I can get another one somewhere else!
B01LRLJV28|1.0|One|June 20, 2017|Good job Sony|After owning Sony consoles since the PS1 was launched over 20 years ago, the fact that PS4 gutted the ability for my $300 Harmony remote to turn it on for movie watching (and redid the control scheme to make even this simple task utterly unintuitive)--now that my Sony brand controllers have started lagging to render games nearly unplayable, I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that non-PC gaming is becoming worthless.Good job Sony, you managed to murder a cash cow. I now root for your rapid demise, lest future good would-be 1st party games from whatever part of Naughty Dog survives be wasted on your garbage hardware.
B01LRLJV28|1.0|3|May 2, 2017|It was fun while it lasted|It's only been 6 months and the Playstation had already started to turn off randomly. It was fun while it lasted.

B01LRLJV28|1.0|4|December 25, 2016|I think I got a refurbished one?|So this PlayStation doesn't work well. It crashes constantly unless I turn off system music (weird right? figured out because I would hear constant popping instead of the system music). And the logo on the ps4 looks like it was heavily rubbed? As if someone took an eraser and touched it constantly, and considering this PlayStation is supposed to be brand new it shouldn't look like that. It's a Christmas gift for my sister so I can't just exchange it without inconveniencing her, so I'm very unhappy with this purchase.
B01LRLJV28|1.0|One|May 9, 2017|Unhappy want yo exchange it.!!!!!!!!!!!! Very unhappy.|This is not operating correctly. How can I exchange this. It must have more warranty than 1 month????????? Please provide exchange information!!

Everything looked fine and even turned on... and then it turned off, by itself over and over whenever I played a game. And "Amazon" Warhouse Deals Inc. is third-party so I can't just get a replacement. Looms lime most of the time this product is fine, but buyer beware! You could end up like me, might be better off spending a little more for a new product.

Now the window to return or get support for this product is gone and I'm stuck with a very expensive PlayStation that doesn't work after two months of use.  Needless to say, I am not a happy customer.

B01LRLJV28|1.0|0|January 20, 2017|No Optial Audio on PS4 Slim|The fact that they removed the optical audio output from this device is confounding.  It's included on the basic PS4 and the Pro version.  Without the audio output it's virtually impossible to connect to a PC speaker system (tried a number of work arounds involving DACS, etc.).  The Slim is clearly intended ONLY for TV use.  If you want the higher resolution that a  PC monitor can provide, you're out of luck.

B01LRLJV28|1.0|2|March 31, 2017|I'd give it less stars if I could|Console never operated for longer than 15 mins. Got this so called blue light of death after it crashed which required unplugging the console from the wall just to get it to restart up only to crash after another 15 mins. Very unsatisfied. Never even got to fully set up my PS account before it would crash again. Get your s*** together Sony.
B01LRLJV28|1.0|2|March 11, 2017|Didn't last a month|The console never powered up after I tried to install 4.5 upgrade. Non existent support/customer service to help troubleshoot. I was considering Playstation Vue as my cable provider. But just can't trust the hardware to stay alive. Already missed my return window with Amazon, will probably end up selling to Gamestop for a loss.

B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|June 12, 2017|Lag.|Having lag problems concerning the Bluetooth and while using the earpiece. I've contacted AskPlayStation via Twitter about a solution, but a solution was not given; only troubleshooting guides. I've had these problems since Day 1 and I hope I'm still under warranty. I love Sony, but this is inexcusable.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|40|December 26, 2016|You can own a game but still be required to pay-to-play -- nice...|Should have been an amazing device -- great specs, great games, solid utility.  However, it was only after purchasing several titles and getting the entire system set up that we discovered that there is one detail quietly inserted in the game descriptions that is not at all obvious to first-timers... 'requires PS+' (i.e., a monthly subscription).  I'm sure experienced console gamers out there know to look out for this sort of thing, but for a guy that has spent 20+ years gaming on PCs, it was not even on my radar that you could buy a game and have it *completely* unplayable unless you shell out $5-$10/month to Sony for the rest of the life of the console. I pay for my own internet access and PC servers exist out there -- there is no way Sony needs this money for me to play Overwatch.  They just have the leverage to force people and that's pretty slimy. Now I'm out the cost of my game, but there's no way I'll pay $60/year additionally just play what I've already paid for.  At the very least, they should put a pop-up warning at purchase...  "In order to play this game you will be required to subscribe to PS+."  However, it seems they don't mind holding customers hostage. For the people out there that will no doubt defend Sony, yes they have the right to do whatever they want with their product.  This is about making it very clear to people (especially new ones who I think have a reasonable expectation of being able to play a purchased game without a recurring subscription) that Sony chooses to force customers to pay above and beyond BEFORE somebody has a game purchased and is flat out of luck.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|2|February 11, 2017|Hate the interface, Harmony remote doesn't work with it|Ps4 does not work with Logitech Harmony One remote like my ps3 did, that part sucks. Also the interface is now cluttered with a bunch of garbage advertising for other services and apps, I hate this interface. You screwed up on this generation Sony.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|2|January 10, 2017|Some features don't work|This is supposed to play DVD's as well as Blue Ray disk. The blue ray disk get stuck every time you try to play one. I bought this item because I wanted to use all the features but was unable to do so. So I guess they can keep it.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|5|December 14, 2016|Defective PS4|Received the PS4 very quickly. I immediately opened it and set it up at my apartment. I got it all set up and was playing a game worked great! I then unplugged it and brought it over to my boyfreiend's house plugged it in and the PS4 wouldn't turn on at all. Plugged it into another outlet to see if that was the problem and still encountered the same thing. It doesn't beep and turn on like it's suppose to. I'm currently waiting for a replacement PS4 to arrive. Hope to have better luck with the replacement
B01LRLJV28|2.0|One|January 6, 2017|Controller or charging cable not working|The first day everything was perfect but now, only two days later, there is something wrong with either the controller or the charging cable. It won't pair at all, and I can't tell if it's charging or not! now I have to buy a new controller because even resetting it doesn't help.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|2|February 21, 2017|Two Stars|The controller won't take a charge and appearently this is a widely reported issue.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|One|January 28, 2017|Wifi doesn't work|I set up the wifi and even if the connection test was successful, when attempting to connect to the PSN network the console would hang at a loading screen. I had to move the router next to the console so the console could connect via ethernet
B01LRLJV28|2.0|One|January 26, 2017|Just what Ive read and see!!|The review hasn't anything bad to do with Amazon.. but if you have been with Xbox that's where I'd stay.. The games do have some good graphics but unlike the Playstation 3 u need a card just like the Xbox and Xbox 360 and 1.. more games for Xbox better made and overall not worth the money. The extras are expensive and after I bought it it's gone down 50 dollars within a few days. There is also rumors they are doing away with this system and making an upgrade. It will be hard to expand a collection if finances are not for disposal so easily in the time before they cut off making new and selling games and accessories ..
B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|July 2, 2017|Great games - wish I could actually play them.|As of this review,I have had the system for less than 3 months and it has completely died (as in "cash in that warranty, send it back to customer service" died) twice. I've had an Xbox One for 2 years and haven't had a single problem - save yourself the frustration and get an Xbox instead.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|2|December 26, 2016|Very Disappointed|This item would have been perfect but it almost ruined Christmas Day for my son and because this was the only gift he was asking for and when we open it the item was missing the AC power cord so he could not play it on Christmas without the cord. Luckily after calling around on Christmas Day because everything was closed and I couldn't go buy one I found a friend who had one on his old PlayStation that we can use until the stores open up for us to go buy one. This was so annoying....

PS3 when it first came out it played everything from its previous consoles and it had 4 USB slots 3 card readers this is a joke!
B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|May 9, 2017|Broken Hard Drive|Arrived with a broken hard drive. Nothing else wrong with the console, but still very disappointing. Overall my experience was spoiled.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|One|January 4, 2017|No optical or composite audio outputs!|This model has no optical audio output.  In fact it has no audio output other than the HDMI output which means that if you have a dedicated surround sound receiver you will get no audio when gaming.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|6|December 17, 2016|FALSE ADVERTISING! BE CAUTIOUS!|This really deserves a half of a star. I paid for a console and game bundle, and only recieved the console. There was no game physically present. I expected a little bit of a roughed up console (superficial scratches in the console) or a very poor box. Instead, i just get a console with a game downloaded on there that requires a physical disc to be in the console in ordered to be played. I did get a refund after going through customer service of a decent chunk of my purchase; more than enough to go out to a gamestop and buy the game. That alone is worth another star. What really bugs me is the seal of approval by amazon on the box stating that everything in this box is good to go and be sold. I hope that amazon reps read this review and take it for what its worth. I am a forst time user of this service, and now i am disinclined to use it again.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|August 24, 2017|Cheaply built, lame interface.|The device is fine, however, the PSN is getting crap day by day; No new games, no backward compatible; expensive subscriptions and crap deals, glitchy transaction system. The case construction seems ok but the cable quality provided with this is cheap like chinese ones on ebay. Controller does not hold charge for long. The interface is so lame that I call it just an update of PS3 not an upgrade. I own XboX as well and this cheap thing is nowhere near to XboX construction, service, items, interface quality. I really loved the killzone and uncharted series and wanted to play the latest ones, no new killzone is coming up and uncharted has become lame as drake has been retired completely; I find no reason to keep this wasting my space. I do not recommend this junk from japan (unless you're an indie lover)
B01LRLJV28|2.0|One|January 9, 2017|Two Stars|Just as expected good
B01LRLJV28|2.0|One|May 24, 2017|Two Stars|Uncharted 4 is a waste of money, buy another package or just buy the system alone!
B01LRLJV28|2.0|6|December 2, 2016|Go with the original or pro!!! Stay away from the slim!!|IF YOU HAVE A HIGH END GAMING HEADSET, GO WITH THE ORIGINAL PS4 OR THE PRO. Sony saw fit to remove the digital optical port from the slim version, so unless you have a playstation brand wireless headset, you are gonna be stuck with your tv speakers. Thank you Sony for making us pay extra to retain the same features.

B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|August 21, 2017|Buy yourself a PC|PS4 is a terrible platform with games nobody wants. Uncharted is a game that gives you more cinematic and dialogue than gameplay, and the gameplay is basic. PS4 requires extra money to play with other people online. Sony gets hacked once a year and your credit card info gets stolen. (It happened again yesterday) PS Plus is hard to cancel. Controller battery dies quickly due to stupid blue light.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|4|October 22, 2016|not backwards compatible|graphics are ok. I read with the new update, the ps4 was backwards compatible (plays games from ps3) but it wasn't. The games graphics are ok but definitely not worth $400. I'll pass. Game is nice is design but i''ll stick to xbox 1.
B01LRLJV28|3.0|5|January 12, 2017|Such a meh powerhouse of a console.|I do kinda regret getting a PS4 as the exclusives are nothing special at this moment but I am interested in Yakuza 0, FF7 remake, and several other titles. Everything else, I play on PC. The console will get hot so I strongly recommend getting a base that has fans to help cool it off and help preserve the lifespan of the HDD as well as internal components.
B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|April 4, 2017|Black Screen|My system has a black screen problem, the visual and audio will randomly go out completely (most when i just turn it on after not using it for a day or two). It happened a lot when i just got the system, not so much these days. I still haven't found the reason for this, however i usually plug out the HDMI and plug it in again.

B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|April 26, 2017|It's okay, but really is lacking on the dashboard.|it has its ups and downs. The dashboard isn't as well thought out as the Xbox One's The graphics aren't really any better than the Xbox One's. No free backwards compatibility. The installation time for a game is WAY better than an Xbox one's. It has Bloodborne. If you aren't interested in Bloodborne, and other Japanese games, buy an Xbox one. if you look at the top 10 Ps4 games, most aren't exclusive toPs4. Don't let people upsell you on a Ps4.

B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|August 18, 2017|The best of the worst|I hate consoles. I hate the business policies behind consoles. I hate the monetization of consoles. I hate console exclusives. BUT there are some PlayStation ONLY games this gen that I'm not passing on just because I think this is a $250 crappy media machine with games that are more expensive than their counterparts on PC and a monthly subscription required to be able to do 1/2 of the things. This is the most affordable way to reliably get into the playstation ecosystem.

B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|July 24, 2017|Not true 1080p gaming|Slower than expected. Main menu is frequently laggy, games take a while to load - unexpected problems on a brand new system. Most games don't even run in true 1080p. Given that it's 2017 and the system is advertised as a 1080p system (while the Pro is 4k) I would expect games to run at a solid 60fps on 1080p, but the reality is 960p and <60fps for most games unfortunately.

Games where purposely weeded out from ps3 to make more options for ps4 making gamers to be forced to upgrade to ps4 for new gaming experiences which are are no better and some a lot worse then the ps3 games. I was a huge fan of red dead redemption but there is not an option for the ps4 to play this game. There are some that you can play if you pay a monthly subscription to playstation now. Just another way for sony to squeeze more money out of gamers . P..S. I could only hold 11 games worth of data on a 500 GB PS4.

Im not a hardcore gamer, I play for like 2 hours before work, and watch Netflix and other TV apps for like 2 hours at night before sleep. So dont know whats gone wrong.

We have 2 wireless headsets that will not work with this because there is no optical port on the this. It is on the PS4 & PS3, but Sony apparently didn't think about it when they made the Slim. So, now I have to either purchase 2 more headsets that do not require the optical cord (at least $200) or buy a converter box ($25-$50). Had I known that, I would've purchased the older PS4.

B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|September 18, 2017|My least favorite PS! :(|I purchased the PS4 Slim for one game... MLB: The Show. The console disappoints. It's design put style over practicality. The plastic feels cheap. The venting for air flow is inadequate. It's noisy. Of all the PlayStations over the years, I'm surprised the latest one is my least favorite.

It was kinda disappointing for my husband and I because we do not have Wifi at the house and aren't so interested in playing online. This limits our game use :(
B01LRLJV28|3.0|5|December 1, 2016|If the Bundled Game is Corrupt, They Will Make You Return the Entire System, Which Makes Absolutely No Sense.|The Uncharted 4 disc was corrupt, so instead of being able to return the game only, I'm being forced to return the system and everything.  This is extremely infuriating when you have put countless hours (10-20) into updates, downloads, installations, and game play that will all be completely vacated since Amazon can't send me a $20 game.
B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|January 23, 2017|Three Stars|Good product unless you get banned by PlayStation then pretty much useless.
B01LRLJV28|3.0|3|January 9, 2017|Regional issues|Was a bit a frustrated as I ordered this as a gift for my Husband and Son and didn't realise firstly there are regional restrictions and secondly there is a monthly membership needed to get extra content etc. I was sent a code to enter for a free year PS4 membership but the system won't accept the code and finding someway to email someone for help proved very difficult. Also when it arrived it came with a USA plug, the fact that is was being shipped to an Irish address didn't give a hint to the seller that a USA plug would not work :( - I feel sorry for any parent that ordered this as a Christmas gift, only to find this one on the day. Luckily we happened to have an adapter that we were able to take off something else and put on this otherwise they would have been really upset.  I think this should have been clearly stated or an adapter included in packages shipped overseas It is all set up now and working fine but looking back now I wish I had just bought this from a local store
B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|March 7, 2017|Over priced money drain machine|I like my new PS4, but it's really over priced, this thing costs too much money to run .... you need another controller, you have to pay for every single option, games are expensive, PS Plus needs money every month or 3 months or whatever way you want . PS Now isn't free ... so why this thing costs over $269 by the time i made the purchase ? .

B01LRLJV28|3.0|3|December 9, 2016|Next time check prices|Very disappointed should have checked Walmart first they had better pricing but otherwise the product is good just could have saved a little money is all
B01LRLJV28|3.0|4|December 27, 2016|Noisy as hell|Unlike the regular PS4 the Slim is really noisy. The Slim is my kids system and they asked me if it was OK/broke because of the noise, my answer is I don't know if it is normal or a bad unit. I see lots of debates on it being the fans running when hot but that is not it, at least in my case, it's the BlueRay drive spinning at max speed which is noisy itself but it also vibrates the whole console causing even more noise.  I use my regular PS 4 to watch BlueRay movies but if the Slim makes all that noise on a movie it wouldn't be usable but I haven't tried that yet as the Slim is my kids system. While the PS4 Slim seems like a good game console I can't give  it better then 3 stars as the noise it makes is just silly and ruins the experience .
B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|February 21, 2017|Get the PRO!!!|I feel like this version will be left in the dust as far as developers stepping up their games for the PRO.

It is made for such an stable energy supply that it can handle a few failures. Who doesn't experience power shortage due to blown breakers, connectors failure or a simply blunder like turning the energy off by accident. Console freezes or does not work well when power returns. Did not have that problem with PS3, WII and some older consoles I had..
B01LRLJV28|3.0|0|July 20, 2017|Its ok|It's ok... between Playstations plus and Microsofts Xbox Live: Xbox wins hands down with more content, easier access to content and overall value. Not impressed with PS4... I will be going back to my Xbox One now (4 free games a month with their service).

After that there were no failures.

B01LRLJV28|3.0|One|July 13, 2017|3/5 stars|I love it. Came very well packaged. However, it makes it a weird noise when I insert or remove disks.. also when it reads disks. The noise sounds like it pauses from inserting the disk rapidly and the same when reading or removing. Overall it works great.

B01LRLJV28|4.0|4|December 27, 2016|Good console|Package came a day early which is a plus. It's a great console. But trying to get the internet set up took me 5 DAYS just to do because of all the error I kept getting, and it wasn't from my end cause every wifi available product I had, had worked So while it was a chore and really frustrating trying to get the internet on (kept searching and trying all the solutions I could find in forums) but as soon as I got the internet to work the console is great overall.
B01LRLJV28|4.0|One|January 15, 2017|Not bad|I'll give it 4 stars cuz even tho it's a great system, the process for online play is a pain, in my opinion it was better on the PS3 aside from that everything works perfectly fine.

I only minus 1 star because  I hate that  Playstation  doesnt do backward compatibility.  I have tons of ps3 games that are now coasters because our ps3 stopped working.  I like the new slim design and it doesnt seem to run as hot as  my previous  system. This bundle came with uncharted 4 game, which  was great. We already completed  the game and it was very fun. It also came with 1 wireless remote. These new remotes  are great and fit my hands a vit better than the previous  version.

Graphics are as expected, internet streaming is only as good as your ISP though. Only problem: Got the bundle with one year subscription to PS Online but now they have completely revamped the format and most things are free. So, kind of wasted the money but not as much as buying it off the shelf for $50 more at Costco.

B01LRLJV28|4.0|4|January 4, 2017|Like it, hoping no more issues|My son likes the PS4, however when he first opened it and loaded the game that came with it, the PS4 would not load the game or work. Gave him an error message, we did clean the game to see if it helped and it loaded fine.  I bought him another game to see if it would work and it did.  Hoping the PS4 doesn't have an issue going forward and that it was just poor service that the new game included with it was dirty right out of the box.  My son is 28, has had the PS3 and is very familiar with it and handling of the games so definitely a manufacturer issue.

B01LRLJV28|4.0|0|April 24, 2017|Solid system.|While technically a superior system to the xb1 S, it comes at a cost of a lot of cooling fan noise. Compared to the xb1 it sounds like a jet turbine.

I absolutely hate the thumb sticks on these controllers, especially the left one. First off, they have very limited grip - my thumb was constantly slipping off before I bought third party grips to put on them. Secondly, for me, they are very fatiguing to my thumbs. In games (all of them) where you need to push the left thumb stick forward for movement, it just feels like such a chore to hold the stick down. Overall: 4/5 stars

I was concerned about excessive heat build up and poor ventilation, but so far so good. Others have complained about it being noisy, but I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. I'd buy it again. Time will tell if it holds up. I was impressed that it included everything to get started right away, including power cord, HDMI cable, and even an earbud with microphone. Serious gamers would certainly want to replace the earbud with a real headset, but it was a nice "get you by" feature that I didn't expect. If you get it on sale, it's a great value.

If you like stealth take downs and gun fights this game is for you. There are some thematic scenes that take a while to watch, but the story was well done and I would definitely buy a 5th one if they ever made one. The system I have no complaints about.

My ps4 came with everything it was supposed to come with, along with the fact that my ps4 is like new. Being completely honest— the only "used" feature I found, was that Black Ops 3 was already downloaded on the game. Other than at the thing was completely new.

B01LRLJV28|5.0|One|January 25, 2017|Got this on black Friday and glad I did|Got this on black Friday and glad I did.  Way better than the Xbox one in my experience.  Xbox one disc drive sounds like it's going to explode.  I'm a casual gamer and like to use these for gaming here and there and for the blue ray DVD
B01LRLJV28|5.0|0|April 24, 2017|Exactly as advertised|Bought this as a gift but own this same bundle myself. PS4 slim works great, nice to have the power supply built in. Uncharted 4 was really fun, graphics were awesome. I don't own a 4k TV so this was a good fit for me.
B01LRLJV28|5.0|One|December 28, 2016|Awesome Gift!|I didn't know what I was buying. My son wanted this for Christmas and Cyber Monday was my saviour!!!!!  Got it on time as described but the look on my son's face when he opened the box and realized that it was the slim version was priceless!!!!!!  I have a VERY happy kid!!!!
B01LRLJV28|5.0|2|April 5, 2017|Brand new ps4!|Good price, recommended 100%
B01LRLJV28|5.0|0|May 16, 2017|Five Stars|The best price I found for a PS4. Came super quick (less then 48 hours) Excited!!!!!!!!!!

B01LRLJV28|5.0|One|May 14, 2017|Nice deal.|I like it been playing playstation since PS one day's. Great graphics and lot's of fun. I'm happy with this purchase.
B01LRLJV28|5.0|0|August 10, 2017|An amazing deal|It's really a good deal. The PlayStation 4 slim has a really nice design that allows a horizontal and vertical placement. The slim offers all the same options and characteristics as the regular one. The storage off 500GB is enough to download 5 to 6 games new generation. And the game uncharted 4 was really good. Mind blowing graphics and an awesome soundtrack. Once again really satisfied by this purchase. I recommend this product.
B01LRLJV28|5.0|6|April 11, 2017|Playstation TOO FREAKING EXTREME!|This is "the other woman". I spend as much time with this as I do with my wife.
B01LRLJV28|5.0|0|May 8, 2017|My son loved the gift!!|Very nice graphics and sound, compact  and light to take with you, my son loves it cant keep him off playing it!!
B019VM3F2M|1.0|1|September 22, 2016|Doesn't hold up|I have enjoyed my Fitbit blaze but after 6 months the back of the blaze (the pebble not the band ) is giving me a rash
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|June 27, 2017|Maybe just a fluke or not?|It worked great at first but after a month the display no longer worked. Return window was closed 2 weeks ago and no instructions available on how to get it replaced.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|September 20, 2017|Very hard to sync!!|I sync this with my Samsung Galaxy Note 4,and it is a daily chore.  After one year, of trying all kinds of tricks, including rebooting the phone, rebooting the Blaze, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I give up.  I'll wear it as a watch, but I've uninstalled the app permanently.  I realized it was a daily irritant; who needs that?!
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|March 16, 2017|My 2nd fit bit in the last few years, ...|My 2nd fit bit in the last few years, Ist one band fell apart and they would not replace the unit with out jumping though hoops to get it done. Would not simply exchange the product. Now my blaze will no stay sync'd with my phone, even after trying to sync manually, it will not connect and say connected. Looked at my watch today and it is telling me the wrong time. Looked at my phone and it has not sync'd in over two weeks and still cannot manually connect it. Find another product, especially at the $180.00 price tag they are asking for.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|2|July 13, 2017|Cannot get it to sync with my iPhone. The ...|Cannot get it to sync with my iPhone. The heart rate monitor has a light that makes it hard to wear at night (for sleep monitoring). Clunky to wear.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|June 22, 2016|Worst buy|When I first got it in March, from time to time it would not connect to my Bluetooth.  Then it would happen more frequently and I usually was able to fix it myself. Now, for over a week I have not been able to connect it. I just use it as a watch now. Can't use any of the features I bought the damn thing for. I've tried every trouble shooting thing possible and nothing. I should've returned it at the first sign of flaw.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|August 12, 2017|Band Size Issue|Very disappointed in band size.  I followed the instructions carefully and the band is way too big.  I contacted Fitbit and they said I would need to work through Amazon to get an exchange.  If I had purchased through Fitbit, they could have done a band exchange.  Problem was Fitbit didn't have what I wanted in stock, but Amazon did.  Bummer.  My suggestions: Don't order via Amazon.  If you are inbetween sizes, don't order up as suggested.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|1|May 16, 2017|Save your money !|Had this for 3wks and heart rate monitor died . Definitely Sending it back for a refund.

B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|March 23, 2016|It's been a very frustrating experience and would not recommend getting this item|The Fitbit Blaze has been a disaster.  I ordered one about 1 1/2 weeks ago, but was not able to make it setup or work with any of my devices.  It would not work with either of my laptops or my phone.  Thinking it might have been a defective tracker, I asked for a replacement.  I've had the same problem with the new tracker, so it too will be returned. It's been a very frustrating experience and would not recommend getting this item.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|September 18, 2016|Terrible.|I'm a long time fitbit user, starting in Jan of 2015.  I've had the charge HR, surge, blaze, and now the charge 2.  The blaze looks neat online but was far too bulky and uncomfortable on my wrist.  Mine also came damaged as the back light barely works, it's very dim and almost unreadable.  I'm returning it.

B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|August 10, 2016|UPDATE: I thought I had the charging problem solved, but it only lasted for two weeks.|This device would not charge out of the box. I called customer support - USELESS! I refuse to return it and get a refurbished device when I just dropped cash for a new one. UPDATE: I found the solution to this problem. The watches that come from Fitbit directly have a full battery. The watches that come through Amazon or other sellers do not. The device will not show the charging screen until the device software is updated. It will not update until the device is charged. If you put it into the cradle, you will not see the battery charging icon before updating the software but it will charge. It charges very slowly from the USB port, but faster from a wall adapter. Mine is working perfectly fine now.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|January 26, 2017|Worst FitBit ever|Worst FitBit ever! Has a lot of bugs; does not sync well; inaccurate steps; freezes; poor battery life; inaccurate sleep monitoring and undocumented burned calories. Stay away from this product! I have an FitBit Charge HR and it works fine and better than this piece of crap! Don't buy! You've been warned!
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|August 19, 2016|A piece of JUNK - I tried for two weeks ...|A piece of JUNK - I tried for two weeks to sync the product with the software provided by FITBIT. No success. I contacted FITBIT twice by phone and once via e-mail with little help from their customer service. The "SYNC Program" requests that a USB Dongle be installed. The company claims the dongle is NOT needed. I purchased one as it is NOT included in the package. It did not help. The device would NOT SYNC! Why does the program request that a Dongle be installed when NONE is needed? FITBIT could NOT provide an answer. I finally returned the device to Amazon. for a refund. I am still stuck with the USB Dongle and other associated cost. NEVER AGAIN.

B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|August 19, 2017|Not worth the money - lasts for 3 months|Had this watch for 3 months.  Battery life went from 5 days with heat rate monitor to 2 hours.  Bad tech and terrible customer service by @amazon for not taking care of the purchase since it was through Prime.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|May 12, 2016|Non functional. Poor design.|Out of the box would not pair.  Poor design regarding removing watch to charge. Shipping box beautiful, function and design of watch  poor.

B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|March 30, 2016|Buy only if you are spending cash aimlessly!|The Good: Looks and feels good. The Bad: The first thing that pops up when you press a button is [...]. As if everyone is able to explore the web at all times. After that you get a link to a Fitbit App, which doesn't recognize bluetooth on Mac and it asks you to download it on your iOS or Android enabled device. As if, everyone has an iOS or Android enabled device. The Very Bad: After all App problems and successful setup of the watch I found out that the software on the watch enables you less than a normal watch. No adjustment of time, no time zone switch without connection to app on computer or phone and without internet. The Bad in Hilarious Kind Of Way: Heart Rate is rarely accurate. No HR Zone options. Does not support sync with apps such as Sleep Cycle or Apple Health. The Bad in Misleading Kind Of Way: FitBit writes it is GPS enabled. That doesn't mean it has GPS, but that it can use your phone's GPS. I wonder how many besides me got that one wrong. The Bottom Line: Expensive peace of plastic made for people who don't travel, don't exercise and are one with their computers and phones at all times. I would return it, if the Amazon policy would allow it.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|September 2, 2017|Please pass on this|I loved the first fit bit I owned. erro This sucks... especially for the money. Too much Problems with software and updating etc

B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|June 17, 2016|Defective out of the box|Defective out of the box.  Charged and setup the Blaze.  After initial swipe to display the Fitness page, it would not swipe to any other page or would not jump back to the clock.  Worked through all suggestions on the community site (resetting the Fitbit seemed to be the consensus on how to fix the issue), none of the recommendations fixed the issue.  Sending back for an exchange.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|June 22, 2017|Do not buy this product - major battery issues with FitBit Blaze|do not buy this product.  I had a FitBit Surge for 2 years and it worked great.  I decided I wanted a little bit more "classy looking" watch and went with the Blaze.  The battery I had for the first Blaze lasted about 2 months and then it wouldn't hold a charge.  FitBit sends me a replacement Blaze and the battery on that Blaze loses the charge within 11 hours.  There are numerous stories on the internet of unhappy customers who own the FitBit Blaze that have had battery issues.  Completely disappointed with this product.  Time for an Apple Watch.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|May 18, 2016|Confused!|I received an empty box and no fitbit blaze but I was charged $199.95 for it? Now I am trying to get a refund!
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|August 17, 2016|So disappointed....|I was so excited about getting this. And it worked for a little while. All of the sudden, it stopped syncing my notifications. When I contacted FitBit, they told me yeah, sorry! That was it....no help, no nothing. It just doesn't work anymore. So, I just went and a bought an Apple Watch.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|October 8, 2016|Worthless Product!!|Don't buy it!!  Piece of crap.  Had mine 3 months and seemed to work fine.  Tired to do a software update on the app (got the notification that the update was  available) and ever since not working;  not connecting with the app.  Just spent 45 minutes on the phone with the company IT person and they cannot fix it either. Going to send me a dongle so we can "try" to fix it on the PC but who knows. No refund since over 3 months old.  Additionally, my wife had a Charge and after the screen separated from the band and started to come apart.  She trashed it and I will trash  this one.  Worthless.  Try a different company.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|February 29, 2016|Very dissappointed!|My 4th Fitbit, best one so far.  Love the dial to see progress. Love that it tracks cycling!!! Update:  very dissappointed, the face is way to big for a woman's small wrist and looks ridiculous!  Cycling tracker doesn't at all tie into you Fitbit step tracker unless you where it on your ankle.  Wasted money for it and accessories.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|June 23, 2016|don't waste your money|don't waste your money, had it for about 2 weeks went for a jog looked at the display and it was totally shattered. might as well have taken $200.00 and thrown it out the window.

We talked with Fitbit directly & are in the middle of a exchange process with them, but have been w/o the watch for 8-10 days.  Not sure if others are having similar battery issues, or if we just got a lemon.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|May 12, 2017|Rip off|I bought this and it stop working after 3 months. The battery does not charge and I contact the seller and he told me is a disposable watch?! I regret this purchase. And I took very good care of it. I will never buy this brand again.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|December 6, 2016|Broken...|The watch was broken upon arrival.  The heart rate monitor would not work. Wasted 2 hours charging and setting it up, then another hour talking to Fitbit customer service.  On a positive note, Fitbit is replacing the tracker.  However, now I have to wait another week to get the replacement.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|February 29, 2016|heading for return|Heading for return........just recieved it. The start up and updating took over 90 mins. Had to call support and it had issues with windows. Now device seems to be measuring heart rate...but app shows no measurements. Kind of point less without the heart monitor. Also. Now cheaper by 12 bucks at Walmart
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|October 10, 2016|Do not buy|Battery went from lasting five days to five hours and I have only had it 2 months. In the 2 months I have had it I've used it for maybe a month. Not worth the 200 bucks
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|May 18, 2016|Worthless!!!!|Worthless piece of junk! Does not sync!!!! Waste of money...by the time you figure out it won't sync..you can't return it!
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|June 25, 2017|Not Worth It - Save your money.|Worked great and I loved it for about 4 months. It went from holding a charge for 4 or 5 days to less than a day in a week time. A quick internet search shows this is a very common thing. The fix? Buy a new one! Almost $200 and it's good for 4 months? Ridiculous. Save your money.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|April 30, 2017|Defective|This is my second one. The first one stopped working within a month. This one lasted slightly longer but has also already stopped working after less than 4 months.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|December 21, 2016|Help|Received my fitbit today but it didn't come with directions or any information whatsoever, any ideas
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|November 16, 2016|Time zone issues|Awful!!!  I went to the East Coast last week and now the watch will not switch back to Pacific Time.  Tried all the tricks as shown on line, no success.  Bought the watch 8/22/2016, not able to return in November 2016?!?!?
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|July 11, 2016|Older iPads are not supported!|Most of the data collected by the Fitbit is only accessible by the software loaded on a companion device.  Unfortunately, older model iPads and iPhones are "not supported" and thus the watch wont sync up.  A huge disappointment.
B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|July 8, 2017|Terrible|Clearly mine is defective. It was delivered to me In May and it's already blinking and flashing!

B019VM3F2M|1.0|0|October 6, 2016|Health warning: ALLERGIC REACTION TO WRISTBAND!|I developed a Class IV allergic reaction to the wrist band. I had to stop using it and treat the ski lesion with steroids. Then I tried it again... same lesion reappeared. Changed to the contralateral wrist... same result. IT IS THE BAND. Interestingly,my wife developed the same reaction. None of us is allergic to anything skin-related,by the way. DO NOT BUY
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|July 21, 2017|Needs to be charged too often.....|Nice watch overall but it needs to be charged every 2 days which is very annoying. I just wanted it because the face was big and I wanted to count steps.....
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|June 7, 2016|meh- I returned it|This doesn't properly track flights of stairs. Flights must be 10' or greater to count, you cannot be holding the hand rail, you cannot be carrying something that restricts the movement of your arm.  I found the step tracker in general to be not very accurate. If you're walking across a parking lot, it is fine, but if you're trying to squeeze in some last minute steps to meet your goal by stepping in place, it doesn't track them at all.  I thought these features were pretty basic, and this Blaze was too expensive to get this wrong.  There are much cheaper alternatives that do just as well or better. I was interested in this for the heart rate monitoring, which seemed accurate to me when I checked my pulse myself. It provides a nice analysis of the heart rate. It was nice to get text notifications on the watch, but it also allows you to answer an incoming phone call on the watch, which is weird because then you have to go find your phone while the other party is waiting.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|June 28, 2016|Decent fitness tracker, poor smart watch capabilities|I wanted to like this, but it wasn't worth $200. The notification system for android is terrible.  I would got 3-8 separate notifications about a text message or call, even though I really only got one text.  I Googled ghee issue abs apparently Fitbit has been aware of the issue since March, still no fix. To me, it failed to function as a smart watch. Therefore,  it was just am overpriced fitness tracker. You can get other fitness trackers that do more (like built in GPS) for less.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|May 5, 2016|Battery keeps dying quicker and quicker.|The watch does work and keeps time correctly. The heart rate monitor is great to have for when you're exercising. The menu controls are not that great and could use some improvement. I feel that its way over priced at $200. It should be more like $100. Cons: Battery keeps getting worse and worse. First time charging: 5 days of battery. Second Charge: 3 days of battery. The watch itself feels cheap and doesn't feel like its well made. The watch should be waterproof like other manufactures of these types of watches.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|May 13, 2016|Fitbit not so accurate|So I got the Fitbit as a gift for myself... I wanted something to track my steps and heart rate.. However the blaze is far from accurate... I had the blaze on the charger over night and when I woke up it told me I had walked 600 steps and burned 300 cAlories meanwhile it never moved.. When I do wear it, it makes a little square indent from the battery in the back... Also I found my fingers tingling and pain in my wrist... I took it off and took about 6 hours for the tingling to go away... Sadly nothing on this blaze is accurate

Took too many attempts to sync to iPod and customer support advised me to return the product to amazon. Will wait it out and hopefully be able to write a better review
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|September 20, 2017|Battery Failure shortly after Warranty Expiration|I start by saying I like the device a lot.  The reason for the 2 star is early battery failure.  I've had the device for 19 months and it will only hold a charge for about 6 hours.  At the price I paid that amounts to over $11/mo cost average to use the device.  After some negotiating, Fitbit is sending me a new device as a replacement.  If that device also lasts the same amount of time, that will average out to over $5.50 per month. I hope this one holds longer but, if it doesn't, I'll be looking for a different device. BTW, the device did drop down to the 6 hour discharge window in a couple of days, but I did notice a slow progression over the last 6-8 months where it was requiring charging more and more often.  New, it lasted over a week, a few weeks ago it was down to 3-4 days, and now it's 6 hours.  Very disappointing.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|2|July 20, 2016|Not recommended for biking|Not recommended for biking. Fitbit app requires IPhone Location Services to be 'Always On'. If set Location Services to 'While Using App', it will not track your bike ride. Buy the cheaper version for the heart rate monitor, and download a free biking app.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|January 24, 2017|VERY DISAPPOINTED. I was hoping for a great fitness band ...|VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I was hoping for a great fitness band that would be similar to the Apple watch but for my android. I've been SO frustrated with just trying to keep it paired. I printed the manual and went through everything step by step to make sure I wasn't missing anything. I thought I finally had it working, which I did... For a couple of days. That has been the longest I have been able to have the info feed tho the  app where it's useful. I don't know if I have a faulty device, but I'm sorry I purchased it.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|September 18, 2017|Does not work with S8|Fitbit states this works with Samsung S8, but it does not.  Worked fine with my previous phone, so I know it's not operator error.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|May 25, 2016|Bluetooth connection does not work !!|Extremely disappointed. I am a fanatic MTB biker and I bought the watch to use the Exercise Bike feature, however the Bluetooth connection with cellphone does not work properly and I have not been able to track nor monitor biking distance, average or current speed.  Bluetooth is activated on my cellphone and I have tried several times but the watch simply cannot detect my cellphone (not even if I place my phone like 3 inches close to the watch !!) The notifications are not coming in neither even though I have the setting for Notifications set to "yes".
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|September 12, 2017|Fine for all thw health stuff, bad for all the smart watch stuff.|Won't stay paird with my phone. Every time someone calls I check the watch to see who's calling only to find out that it's no longer paird. Keeps track of all my biometrics just fine.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|May 23, 2017|This is a nice fitness tracker|This is a nice fitness tracker. I would give it five stars except for the battery life. It barely lasts  three days and than it takes two to three  hours to charge. I would not buy this product again. . I bought my wife a TomTom Surge with cardio and music. The battery life on the TomTom is 10 days. It does everything this Fitbit Blaze does.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|July 22, 2017|Amazon did their best to help me and for that I am grateful ...|I had lots of problems and this was the third one I sent back. Amazon did their best to help me and for that I am grateful but after talking to Fitbit they told me I wasn't getting accurate information because it worked off GPS and I needed to work out doors but I work out inside a gym and the walls block the GPS
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|August 1, 2016|I wanted to like this, I really did.|I'm using an Android 5.2.1 device with this product which may impact whether you like it or not.  iOS may handle this device better, but unfortunately for my needs this just wasn't sufficient. The first problem I noticed was the inability to reject calls.  They have reserved this functionality for iOS.  This in itself wasn't a deal breaker, but a bummer. The second problem that did break this for me was text notifications not displaying properly.  If you use any text application beyond the stock one you will get issues, for example if you don't dismiss your texts religiously after receiving them you'll get "X unread messages" where X is the number not yet read.  Since I use my phone as a pager via text messages, I need to be able to glance at my watch regularly to gauge priority without necessarily reading the full text. Combined with how Fitbit has generally blamed the carrier, the app, and the OS it's clear to me they will not be supporting this product nearly enough to justify the cost.  Others can utilize these functions fine, likely via Android Wear acceptable APIs.  The fact that they chose this path screams of lazy development.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|January 30, 2017|What I liked most about this was why I now don't|I purchased this to replace a FitBit Charge 2 that stopped working after a year. When researching a replacement tracker what I liked most about this one was the ability of changing out the bands for variety.  Unfortunately the band that came with the item must have been faulty, one of the latches that allow the removal of the band kept coming undone.  Before I could change out the band I looked down to see the time and it was gone! It was very disappointing to loose something within 3 weeks of owning it. Last time
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|June 5, 2017|great product, if you only need it less than a year|the product itself is great, however i havent even had mine for a year and it needs replaced. i take very good care of it and everything. after the replacement dies i am not wasting 100+ dollars on anymore of these fitness trackers. at least this one lasted longer than my jawbone up2 and the replacement to that COMBINED(9 months)
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|June 29, 2016|Aggravated|If you are a person with an active lifestyle you will probably like this tracker. If you have a very sedentary job and want to use it to remind you to move more do not waste your money. It is also one of the worst sleep trackers I have ever seen. It logs me as asleep when I am awake and moving. The calorie tracker works only moderately well when paired with My Fitness Pal even though it is a recommended compatible app. I would be better off going back to wearing both a watch and a less expensive tracker.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|September 20, 2017|Works, not sure how accurate. The Step count ...|Works, not sure how accurate.  The Step count feature is as much as 40-50% off from my manual pedometer. That pedometer is off by 2-4% in itself.  Also I suffer from rapid heart beat on occasions.  This device does not pick up on that.  While my heart rate on occasion goes to 130-150 beats per minute for ten to twenty minutes, the fit bit rarely goes higher that 70-90 at the same time.  As for its measure of sleep time, it once credited me with and extra 4 hours of sleep when I wasn't wearing it.  It seems more accurate when measuring flights of stairs climbed.  I give it an A for effort, D or F for execution.  It does give an idea of how active you are.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|August 16, 2017|Not worth the money.|Half the time it can't locate my phone for sync when I ride my bike. Sometimes it just stops tracking and I lose the physical workout data. I'm not convinced it is actually tracking correctly. Very frustrating to use this watch. The only thing it does seems to do accurately is record heart rate.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|September 28, 2016|Nice Product but Beware of Heart Rate Monitor Accuracy|I have enjoyed owning the Fitbit Blaze for the past few months but have become increasingly frustrated with the optical heart rate monitor.  If you are looking for an accurate heart rate monitor, avoid the Fitbit Blaze.  I am not asking for exact accuracy.  My expectation is that the HR monitor is within 10 - 15 bmp.  However, the Fitbit Blaze will consistently be off more that 40 bmp, especially when I am doing high intensity workouts.  I have tested this product against an old HR chest strap that I used to have and various machines in the gym (bike, elliptical, etc.) and the Fitbit Blaze is constantly showing a heart rate of 40 - 60 bmp less than my actual heart rate.  When on a cardio machine, the Fitbit Blaze will catch up to my actual heart rate after a few minutes, but my expectation is that it lags by a few seconds, not minutes.  Other than having no faith in the heart rate monitor, I do enjoy using the Fitbit Blaze and I still wear it every day.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|June 8, 2017|Not Impressed|The watch worked great at the beginning didn't have any problems with anything. But in couple of months it's stoped syncing with my phone. So every time when I try to resync it I have to delet my device from apps memory or even reinstall the actual app. On top of everything I started to get rush and skin irritation from the band even tho I don't have any sort of allergies. But during that short time when watch works and I don't have any skin problems I actually really like it.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|2|June 25, 2016|Disappointed|So far I'm not a fan. The watch is very bulking and sits up high because it doesn't lay flat on the wrist. Very uncomfortable. I've tried 3 different bands with it and none that make me want to wear it. I've used it for one run/walk so far. Endomondo measured it as 2.2 miles while the blaze measured only 1.7. I've used endomondo for a couple years and it's always been consistent. Considering the watch is using the same GPS (the one in my phone) I was quite disappointed that it was so far off on the measurement. The battery life is good though.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|June 13, 2017|NOT COMPATIBLE W GALAXY S8 PLUS!|Is NOT compatible with Samsung galaxy s8 plus. Can not receive notifications. Called Fitbit support and they told me sorry my phone is too new and they don't know when they will update their system to be compatible with the S8 Plus. This is unacceptable to me for the simple fact that I have a new phone so these functions should work, not to mention the fact that they State you can receive notifications. Nowhere on the product purchase information does it tell you which phones are compatible in which are not. I spent $150 on this and I am very disappointed than I cannot receive text messages or see who is calling
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|August 20, 2017|Great design, "compatible" devices doesn't mean functional|First time setup completed with seemingly no issues, however since then I have had near constant sync/Bluetooth issues and have never actually gotten notifications to work. From other reviews on Amazon and Fitbit, it seems these issues were common on my Samsung Galaxy s8 because until recently it was not an officially compatible devices. However it has been officially announced compatible as of July, but these issues remain common. Device and Fitbit resets and restarts do not help. I will be returning this device for a different model and giving Fitbit a second chance, as I have liked previous Fitbit and their community/app features are the best in my opinion. Hopefully a different model will actually be compatible as they say this should be. Pros: Design, decent price for a smart watch looking fitness tracker, Fitbit app and community systems, nice acreen Cons: frequent sync delays, Bluetooth unpairing, repairing and setup hit or miss
B019VM3F2M|2.0|2|May 10, 2017|Battery life is absolutely terrible|I've been holding off on the review just to check things out 1st, well, my review is the battery life is absolutely terrible.  The watch itself, not the best but not bad. I have to charge this every 3 days, completely dead.....
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|July 4, 2017|Does not keep good charge, also erases all mememory each days|Product no longer works , do we have any kind of manufacturing warranty ? Does not keep good charge , also erases all mememory each days .
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|October 19, 2016|Not Worth the Money!|Not worth the money, until fitbit fixes the bugs.  Its great for the first 45 days..suddenly when you're outside of the return window, the watch takes a crap!  Its doesn't stay paired, the bluetooth consistently turns off on its own, you have to reboot the watch for the bluetooth option to reappear.  Forget about using its running feature, 9 times out of 10, it will tell you it cannot find your phone! I have a Samsung S6- which their website states is a compatible device...... I've received one replacement and its just as crappy the second time around!
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|September 4, 2016|Not as Expected - Received Used Fitbit|Received an obviously used Fitbit even though paid full retail price for a new Fitbit. The box had clearly been open before. In addition, when examining the main watch component, it was apparent that someone had been using the Fitbit prior to returning the merchandise. There was a film of dirt on the back of the watch that indicated use. Will be returning.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|March 4, 2017|I love this when it works|I love this when it works. Warning! You will have problems with the Fitbit Blaze if you have the current software version on your iPhone. The fact this company did not disclose that upfront is ashame. I was able to sync with the app for a few days then it stopped working. Customer service says they are aware of the problem. They said they have a "toggle" they are sending me. That was a week ago and it finally shipped yesterday. Why so long? And how come this did not come with it? When this product worked I loved it but....
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|September 13, 2017|highly inaccurate and buggy|I purchased two Fitbit Blaze's and I would have to give them a 3/5. I've tested the GPS (mile and step distance) and it would be inaccurate between two people walking together. I would have 15,000 steps, while the person I'm walking with would have 8.000 steps. I'm 6'1'' and Person B is 5'6'' so you expect the shorter person to have more strides. The distance is also inaccurate. I've walked around a track which would be 1 mile, but it reports .65 miles. One of the main reasons I purchased this was to track my HR during workouts and it's been a hit or miss. After heavy deadlifts, where my heart is pounding, this would report my HR as 75...really?!! Not recommended...
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|August 28, 2016|At first I loved using this|At first I loved using this, it was cool and easy to wear and had awesome features, but ultimately I returned it because I noticed the HR monitor was completely off whenever I was doing physical activity. At home or just on a slow (I do mean slow) walk it seemed accurate (I eventually compared it by taking my own HR and by using two other HR monitors) but for fast walking or jogging or running it was substantially underestimating my heart rate. After I finished my morning run for example, it said my HR was in the 120s when it was actually in the 180s.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|May 5, 2017|Battery Life is terrible!|I have been a fan of Fitbit for years; I've always loved their products. When my Charge HR died for the last time my husband convinced me to try a Garmin. I did, ended up disliking it and returned it to purchase the Blaze instead. I loved being back to Fitbit with all the options I loved. I have owned the Blaze for less than two months and if I do not charge it fully, every single night, the battery is dead by 5pm the next day. The battery lasted longer in the beginning but never more than 3 days. My husbands Garmin lasts almost a full week before he needs to charge it. I guess it is time to try another product.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|2|February 8, 2017|I am really disappointed with the quality and consistency of the heart rate ...|I am really disappointed with the quality and consistency of the heart rate monitoring. A little walk with my kids reads as a more strenuous workout than an hour-long crossfit session. This very expensive watch is basically a big, unattractive black square on my wrist that vibrates to remind me to walk. So, so disappointed
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|July 8, 2017|but he doesn't like it either as it is so large|The watch does what it is supposed to do, but is just so large. I wanted to give it to my husband as it just doesn't look right on my small wrist, but he doesn't like it either as it is so large.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|2|April 18, 2017|Didn't meet expectations of advertising....|Did not meet expectations. Changing screens and overall moving around functions is a pain. Fitbit App on iPhone continued to hang. Step count totally inaccurate. WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY SHIPPING FOR THIS TO BE RETURNED? THERE SHOULD BE A REASON FOR RETURN OF "DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS OR UNHAPPY WITH PRODUCT"
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|August 28, 2017|Don't waste your money|Had nothing but problems with the watch. Texts do not come through as they should - get maybe 1 of every 3 texts. Also, sends repeated texts. I get one text on my phone, but it shows up 3 or 4 times on the watch which drains the battery. I also reiceved a phone call that I sent to vm on my phone, however the watch shows the phone is still ringing when it is not. Visually it is so cute and I really liked it - but the way it works is dissapointing. Requesting a refund today and sending it back.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|March 29, 2017|Charge only lasts 30 hours approx.|I love my Fitbit Blaze and wear it everyday.  I am very disappointed that it only stays charged approx. 30-40 hours per charge.  Most other people I know that wear them sy theirs stays charged for 4-5 days!  I won't be recommending this to others because it's not very convenient to wear and I don't get very accurate account of my activity when I'm have to charge it so often. Very disappointed for the money how unreliable my Blaze is.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|September 18, 2016|depends on phone for almost everything.|Don't buy it if you plan to use it with Android, syncing is almost impossible, several pairings needed per day. Also NOT waterproof. use at own risk in pool. does not track without phone. phone pairing will stop during exercise, is really bad. Does not give a warning if you are not active like other trackers. UPDATE: After checking the competition I would have never bought this watch. Way too dependent on the phone. the sync with the phone is just really bad. if i could after 3 months with it, I would return it.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|July 7, 2017|Won't keep charge|It worked amazing for a little under a year and now it won't keep change for more than a couple hours...
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|May 10, 2017|Battery isn't the greatest|Bought this thinking it had a five day batter life. I think we may have received a defective one because the battery drains within hours.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|May 28, 2016|Maybe ok for the average person but no good for someone looking for very accurate stats of a workout|This is a great idea and everything on the watch works great except the HR monitor.  I absolutely love the features and everything the watch does except the HR monitor.  The HR monitor was the main reason I wanted the watch so I could get rid of my chest strap HR monitor.  The watch did very well at tracking HR while running but did a terrible job while I was lifting weights.  I would be in the middle of my lift and look down and the monitor would be stuck on 64 bpm when I know it should be up around 110ish.  All the other features including the calorie tracking were very good and I liked a lot, but if I can't track my workouts then it is no good to me.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|July 27, 2017|Disappointed a diehard Fitbit fan!|Purchased this as a mother's day gift for a fitbit snob.  She hated it.  Was not accurate at all.  After a week of use, she was completely jealous of my Samsung Gear 3.  I got tired of her saying mine doesn't do that.  She is an iphone user, so I sent this back for the apple watch.  She is now in heaven.  It was a nice try Fitbit, but definitely a swing and a miss.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|2|June 1, 2016|Doesn't hold charge|Initially the watch was great. 3 months later it doesn't hold a charge for more than 30 hours and that is without using bluetooth, music, etc. Very unfortunate that I invested so much money (also bought an additional leather band) and it lasted less than 3 months.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|May 14, 2017|Disappointing|Got my fitbit and had it all set up then tried to connect it to my phone to use the music features. Out of three different phones mine is the one that wouldn't work. It says ASUS isn't on their list of supported phones but an older ASUS phone connected fine just like my mother in laws IPhone did. Guess I'll be sending it back and looking for a different device.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|2|June 8, 2016|Doesn't track steps or milage correctly.|At first I really liked the Blaze but it didn't take long for me to suspect that the steps were off. I measured both the steps and the mileage against other devises and route markers. The results varied in how far off the tracker was but each time it came in under. Even running the same test multiple times the difference could vary by as much as 500-800 steps. Unfortunately, due to external circumstances, I was unable to return the Blaze within the Amazon return window. I tried calling Fitbit directly but the would not stand behind the product to allow me to return it.  This is my third Fitbit purchase but it will be my last.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|June 25, 2017|It is really nice, but the band irritated my skin no matter ...|It is really nice, but the band irritated my skin no matter how many times I cleaned it. I ended up giving it to a friend because my wrist was too sensitive.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|0|September 3, 2017|Broken within 6 months...|Bought in March 2017, it's September 2017 and completely broken.  It will not charge no matter what I do.  I was on the phone with fitbit customer service and they had me trying to reset & clean pins but nothing was happening.  I never wear it near water.  This is the 2nd fitbit this year that has broke.  I will probably be switching to Garmin since nobody will help me to replace at this time.
B019VM3F2M|2.0|2|July 6, 2016|Like the features but battery life is two days max|Bought last February.  Like the features but battery life is two days max.  Flip features works only sometimes have to push the button to get the time which is aggravating to say the least.  Steps about 15% inaccurate.  HR monitor reasonably close to my chest monitor just lags in real time.  Mailing mine to the President of Fitbit, he can have it.  Stock near 52 week low, I wonder why????????
B019VM3F2M|2.0|1|June 24, 2017|SAMSUNG S8 AND S8+ USERS|SAMSUNG S8 AND S8+ USERS. Do not buy this, it won't work correctly, there is currently no support for your phone. Notifications won't work and your workouts won't track properly. I'd advise buying another watch or waiting till it supports the S8 line.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|June 8, 2016|You better enjoy taking apart and putting back together this watch every 5 days|Fitbit technology etc is good as noted by others and the reason I bought one after my Fitibit Surge band broke prematurely (and which could not be replaced :(  )  But the time and effort to recharge the watch is really not acceptable.  Was no design option available that did not require a user to basically dismantle and reconstruct the watch every 5 days?  The little clasps to lock and unlock the bands from the watch face holder is an absolute pain for people who are not highly dexterous.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|April 20, 2017|It cant tell time....|Time on this thing hasn't worked for more than a day since it got it. The interface works most of the time, sometimes I can't get to anything but notifications and the clock. I feel like I wasted money and coulda got something cheaper. Takes forever to update too.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|2|May 5, 2016|I like all the features the Blaze offers|I like all the features the Blaze offers, but it has some operating issues. My main problem with my Blaze is that it keeps losing its connection with the app and does not sync. I have to delete it and add it back or turn my phone off and back on. Inhad this problem in the beginning and it seemed to finally resolve itself. After the last system upgrade, it started happening again several times each day. If I had known there would be all the connection problems, I would not have purchased the Blaze and continued using mybOne.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|2|July 20, 2016|Did Not Come With Charger Cable|I just received my Fitbit Blaze in the mail. I was really excited to start wearing it, but when I opened the box, it was packaged without a charging cable... I then called the Fitbit call center to request a charger and I was placed on hold probably a dozen different times. The first representative I spoke with had no idea what she was doing and then she transferred me to another rep so I could sit on hold for another 10 minutes. Absolutely horrible customer service.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|May 13, 2017|Just go to the providers website to buy|I enjoy the phone itself, my only issue is that it's advertised for a longer battery life-i think I read somewhere that you can go 5 days without charging. Mine is not the case, I have to charge it every other day which is super annoying. My charge HR 2 went longer until I needed to charge it. Maybe it's because I bought it directly from the website and the blaze I bought through Amazon, so for those looking to buy it through Amazon, if recommend just purchasing it through the fitbit website because they seen to give out the better quality items for the same price.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|April 8, 2016|So/So|I wanted to love this watch and for the first few weeks I did. However it has a major flaw. The connected GPS is not accurate. I mountain bike. The other night I went on a ride that I know has over 1200 feet of elevation gain and is over a 9 mile ride. At the end of the ride I checked my Fitbit and it shows elevation gain of 320 feet and only 4.5 miles. So it makes it pretty much useless. Another pet peeve is what's the point of the new update that allows you set set your goal to move through out the day but it doesn't have an actual notification to remind you? The app tells you if you moved enough during that time but it doesn't actually remind you to move.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|March 21, 2016|Instructions that came with the watch were useless, since they only directed me to go to ...|I almost returned this watch because it took nearly two days to charge it. Instructions that came with the watch were useless, since they only directed me to go to the Fitbit website. Once online, I could only read how to use it by setting up an account. You can only set up the account by allowing it to update the device first. You can only update the device after it has been charged. The charging apparatus was not exactly intuitive and I could not get detailed instructions without setting up the account, which couldn't be set up until the device had been charged. This was very discouraging when the watch took nearly two days to charge. Once the unit was charged and I was free to move about the Fitbit website, things started to make more sense and now I actually like it better than my traditional watch, except that I would prefer a gold trim, instead of silver, to match my wedding ring.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|September 1, 2017|It's pretty nice but...|Overall I am pretty happy with this product. I would like to see more time screen display options and it would have been nice if this product was waterproof like the my pebble Steel. The product is water resistant but it would have been nice where to be waterproof, also it would have been better if they would have had a magnetic charger like the Pebbles do instead of having to take the center device out and put it in a charging cradle every time
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|June 20, 2017|Get the protection plan|I've had my blaze for over a year and the first year it worked great! No complaints then. After a year the thing gets wonky and the charger connections need attention. If I didn't know any electrical engineers it would have died long ago. Also it is now randomly shutting off for no reason. Has plenty of battery power and just have to hit any button to turn it back on and connect back to the Bluetooth. I have been unable find anything that specifically happens to make it turn itself off.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|August 5, 2016|After 4 months, HR is no longer reading higher than 89 bpm.  Something's wrong.|I am amending my review and taking away one star, because four months later, my heart rate is suddenly being read at no higher than 89 bpm, which is know is absolutely inaccurate because of several reasons:  I can feel my actual heart beat pounding rapidly, two other devices showed me a HR of 140+, it's friggin Leg Day and nothing gets my heart pumping like Leg Day, so there's absolutely no way in heck my pulse is only 84 bpm. Don't get me started on the Customer Service for Fitbit...least helpful I've ever had.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|September 20, 2017|Disappointed.|Step counter is great. Heart rate monitor not great. In fairness, I did swap out the rubberized band for a metal, after-market band, but even when holding securely to my arm it sometimes will not register a realistic heart rate. I've been on exercise bikes at the gym, breathing heavy, sweating buckets and the handlebar heart rate monitor of the bike says I'm at about 135 bpm and this thing tells me I'm at 89. Also, if I let the battery die completely, when I charge it, it starts up with the time as the time that the battery died. It can take as long as a half hour for it to communicate with my Galaxy S7 Edge and reset to the correct time. Very disappointed with this watch. My old Surge was fantastic, but this thing is pretty much a pedometer with a sporadic watch attached to it. I won't be buying another Fitbit product. I'll give the Samsung Gear a shot instead.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|April 20, 2017|I like it, but I do not like that you ...|I like it, but I do not like that you can only get the Fitstar Ab workout on your watch. The rest of the workouts have to be viewed from the computer which defeats the whole purpose. It counts stairs accurately most of the time, and the steps seem to be accurate as well. Not very aesthetically pleasing, but I guess its not meant to be a fashion statement.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|June 25, 2017|battery life sucks|this is my second fitbit blaze. I loved the first one. it lasted forever, easily 4-5 days even with wearing at night. I lost it at the beach one day. So I bought a new one, and it must be faulty. I can barely get two days off a full charge. Not a major issue, but if I go out of town for a weekend, now I have to worry about bringing the charger and it's a pain in the butt. I have it set on minimal battery consumption settings, it doesn't auto sync, the screen is dimmed, and I dont use the bluetooth for music/notifications... pretty disappointing battery life but otherwise it's great
B019VM3F2M|3.0|2|June 5, 2016|Ok, but returned.....|Pro's Nice screen Nice features Seemed relatively accurate. Con's Disliked the side buttons which always paused my workout due to wearing gloves or wrist catching it. Just like the fitbit blaze, the wrist HR never seemed to keep up during High Intensity Workouts. Seems wrist HR bands have ways to go yet. For these reasons, I returned this item.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|July 19, 2017|Poor battery life.|I love the watched itself but I'm a bit disappointed in the battery life. I get about two days on it if I'm lucky and all the notifications are turned off. If I turn on notifications it's charging every day. Also for some reason this one takes longer to link up with my Android phone where my HR2 linked up without issue and very quickly. I do like the ability to change the look of the watch screen.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|December 7, 2016|Good functionality, but vibration alert virtually non-existent|Functionally, I like the Blaze: it has longer battery life than prior models, it tracks a variety of exercises, heart rate, and sleep very nicely.  But one big flaw costs it a star or two: the vibration alert I liked so much on my Charge HR model is virtually gone.  It DOES have a vibration, but it's barely discernible.  If you're exercising or in a public place, there's very little chance you'll feel or hear the alert about various notifications, and you may not be woken up by its vibrating alarm.  i find this extremely disappointing. I'm not going to return it because I like its look and its general operation, but I'll be wearing by old Charge HR to bed so I can be sure to wake up.  Disappointing that Fitbit did not manage to design this correctly.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|June 13, 2016|pc software will not down load, sync Imac only when connected via usb charger will not connect via the bluetooth on imac|worthless will not sync with Windows 10,  Imac you need the blaze plugged into the charger and usb plugged into the imac and it took along time to figure that out given the poor tech support. I've never been so frustrated with a device or the lack of costumer service.  you have to use the charging pod to sync with the mac, got this for my dad and he doesn't have a Smart Phone and doesn't want one but wants to track his exercise and sleeping, so I'll have to see what he thinks about it over time. I like the design and look and hope it works out well for him fortunately he just got a Ipad air 2 which will sync wireless via the blue tooth,  but the initial set up had to be done on the Imac could not even get the pc software to download from the windows store!
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|November 3, 2016|Biggest problem- won't sync with the computer.|Things I like: large sized bands, and available change out bands.  Fairly easy to read and use. Easy to read clock (when it works right.) Things I don't like: it isn't accurate (nowhere near as accurate as the One, and not as accurate as the Charge which was also worse than the One.) It won't sync with my computer (syncs okay with IOS)(which is nowhere near when I try to sync with the computer.) The band isn't very comfortable even though I replaced it with a leather one. It is just too thick and big to be as comfortable as I would like. Battery life is decent and it is easy to charge. Notifications work well but the ability to send a quick yes or no with a  touch would be helpful in the absence of texting. Won't record flights of stairs most of the time (Charge and One did; Charge was best at this.) In general- designs and features are getting better, but performance is getting worse.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|July 29, 2017|Fitbit Blaze Smart Fitness Watch|Purchased as a requested Christmas Gift and while the family member it was for had some repeated syncing and set-up issues the device appears to be working well with minor tech problems here and there. The battery charger has basically been failing to charge reliably for the last couple of months now and will likely need replacing. We had expected an above average to excellent device based on reviews but the Fitbit Blaze Smart Fitness Watch appears to be basically just slightly better than average and now with the failing charger, long term reliability is in question.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 15, 2017|this would probably be perfect for you|I am a small woman and this watch is really large for me. Be aware it does not have GPS unless you have your phone with you so this didn't really fit what I needed. Also, it's so big that I cannot sleep with it on. If you have a larger wrist and don't need GPS, this would probably be perfect for you!
B019VM3F2M|3.0|2|July 24, 2016|Mileage and Step Count off|I really want to love my Fitbit Blaze, but it's hard to.  I love that I can read my text messages and see who is calling through the screen.  I love that I can select exercises and just do it with the watch.  However, I hate that the mile and step count is not accurate.  I have completed multiple 5K's where the step count is only around 4,000 steps and the mileage says 1.5 miles.  With my Fitbit Charge, my mileage was always accurate and my steps were on point. I really hope this is something that can be fixed in the near future because I really want to love it, and I don't.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|March 30, 2016|Not bad but not that great|I'm loving this product so far. It has really motivated me to get up off my butt and move. I'm losing weight again and hopefully, this time will hit my target goal and keep myself in a healthy range.  The heart rate monitor did stop working at one point but a reboot of the watch easily fixed that. Update: 1/3/17 The watch is now slowly dying and not holding a full charge. The screen is doing some weird lines across the display periodically. I don't feel like this Fitbit was built as sturdy as some of the other models out there.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|May 31, 2016|Good watch and fitness companion, great heart rate monitor, terrible connections.|I love the watch itself, mainly because the heart monitor is almost dead on compared to other heartmonitors, however it is severely limiting in hooking up with most new phones. I had a Volt and it worked great with it, but the Volt is fairly old and mine died. Fun times. So I was looking to get a new one, and almost all new phones outside of the iphones didn't work with it. I could get some to connect to it with "classic" mode, but it wouldn't actually DO anything (not even teh music like it's supposed to) really unhappy with it. Returning it for a much cheaper smart watch that will actually work with phones instead of this one. Not worth $200, but it IS a good watch if it actually connects to your phone. I really enjoyed being able to switch bands, and bought a few (damn me for wanting to look fashionable)
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|March 21, 2017|Best battery life of any smart watch I've had but|Seriously this thing needs like 20 x the watch faces it has like 10. It holds a charge a decent amount of time. But don't expect to charge it on the go unless you remember it's weird charger. I wish it could just plug into a standard phone charger.  It is a good fitness tracker but all its smart watch functions seem dated compared to anything else. I ended up going back to my Samsung Gear 2 over this.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 1, 2017|Be careful!!....Might say "New", but selling as refurbished Fitbit|I bought this product because it said it was new, but come to find out, it was refurbished. I was the second owner. First bought in July 2016, fixed in Jan 2017 and sold to me. Giving 3 stars because this product was owned before. Other than getting a refurbished Fitbit, this thing got me more motivated to workout. I can tell when my anxiety is kicking in (due to ptsd) because my heart rate will rise. Before this I counldnt tell until i was having chest pains. Loved it. Feel naked without it.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 26, 2016|... first fitness watch and I have to say I love it! Being able to track my activity is ...|This is my first fitness watch and I have to say I love it! Being able to track my activity is really fun and seeing my sleep and heart rate is a great plus. The ability to link up with myfitnesspal pushes this product over the top! UPDATE: I've now owned this watch for a little over a year and have to say its proven to be a bit mediocre. My biggest complaints have to be the issue with syncing that sometimes occur, the shorter battery life as time passes, and the fact that the band broke completely in just a years time. With a price tag of $200 I assumed this product would be a lot more reliable. While it does what it says it does, it does not stand the test of time.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|June 29, 2017|Charger breaks easily|I purchased this for my 14 year old son for Christmas. He insisted on the Fitbit instead of the Apple Watch. For the most part he likes it, however, one of the charging ports on the charging cradle have pushed in and I am unable to get it to pop back out leaving us unable to use either the charger or the band because it is unable to be charged.  I can't even be sure how this happened as it's not really something that gets a lot of use (the charger).
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|July 18, 2016|good|So far lots of fun. It seems to take some experimenting on getting data from apps to sync cohesively. For Example: if I am biking, I use both the Fitbit and Map My Ride app I get all of the metrics collectively, so the fitbit says I burned 2x calories, biked for 2x time and so on. I would prefer it to know that I couldn't be riding 2 different bikes at the same time. I also find a large discrepancy in the mileage and calorie burn. If I use just the Map My Ride app the fitbit gives me metrics for having climbed multiple stories, due to the elevation rises on my bike ride presumably. I use the My Fitness pal app as well and it again takes the metrics and combines them collectively, I would like to see a setting to choose which one I want to use data from. It looks good, light weight, screen is easy to see and use. it seems that it was released before it should have been because the fitbit instructions suck and most of the functions I have discovered have come from google searches.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 17, 2017|Could be SO MUCH better|I cannot understand why Fitbit sends out rather expensive watches with no charge in the battery and no instructions on how to set it up or even how to charge it in the first place. I have gone through several Fitbits and the rechargeable batteries never last more that 12-18 months. On the positive side, the step counter is fairly accurate and the software is useful.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|December 15, 2016|I like it, does exactly what it is supposed to ...|I like it, does exactly what it is supposed to as far as track my fitness. Love the iphone app it syncs with, and LOVE the feature it has that alerts me of phone features, texts, calls, alarms. The thing I really dislike, and mentioned by hundreds of others...the unpredictability of the "watch" to actually function when I turn my wrist. It works maybe 3 out of 5 times. Not positive but I think the longer its asleep, that is when it doesn't like to "wake up". For that reason alone, it only gets a 3 and I render the price tag way out of its league
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|September 25, 2016|It's like wearing two watches and it gets annoying|I wear a baby gshock for the second hand since I'm a nurse so this is too bulky to wear at work where I get most of my steps in. It's like wearing two watches and it gets annoying. It also doesn't push notifications most of the time when you set it to do so. I can't access my call and text records and it really only keeps track of the fitness of  the watch. If you are buying it for the "smart watch" aspect, don't. If you are buying it for the screen to be able to access your workout without your phone, get it! It's GREAT to have the watch on and to just tap your wrist for your workout log, current workout, time, mileage, etc. To track fitness and nutrition information from your wrist. But it's no smart watch.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 25, 2017|Blaze does not work well with a Samsung S8|1st one worked great for about a week, then a charge would only last for 4 hours, replacement from Amazon did not work at all so I called Fitbit and they sent a 3rd one.  It will not connect to my Samsung S8 but did initially work with my Samsung Note 5.  Call to and a trip to the Sprint store did not fix the bluetooth connectivity issues!  I have had 4 different Fitbits and by far the least productive due to these issues.  Either Fitbit or Samsung need to correct this!
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|September 5, 2017|and some of the features are cool but the heart rate monitor stopped working after 1|Works well, and some of the features are cool but the heart rate monitor stopped working after 1.5 years and fitbits response was basically, "More than 365 days than when you bought it? Tough luck, here's a link to buy a new one."
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|February 26, 2017|4 months of use and then started to quit.|I received this in October and by February it stopped functioning properly.  The display no longer activated with wrist movement and the step timer would stop and start. Bugs need to be worked out of this design.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|September 5, 2017|Updated‪: So sad! In true fassion my #fitbit blaze broke just over the year warranty.|Updated: I finally got in touch with a customer support person. Review went from 1 star to 3 stars only because they went out of their way to make things right and offered a one time out of warranty replacement. This does not change the track record of unreliability for Fitbit trackers. Original review: ‪So sad! In true fassion my #fitbit blaze broke just over the year warranty.  I put this thing through a lot and thought I finally got a good Fitbit. But just like always, Fitbit I have last just over a year before something goes wrong. This time the screen cracked. Really!? $200 watch worthless. Contacted @fitbit @FitbitSupport #noresponse ‬if you are going to by a Fitbit plan on getting a new one every 13 months or so.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 25, 2016|a bit disappointed. I upgraded from a Fitbit HR (which died ...|a bit disappointed. I upgraded from a Fitbit HR (which died on me after six months for unknown reasons), my husband still wears his with no problems... the Blaze face is much bigger, which I expected, but not enough features to make that irrelevant. The battery lasted a few days before needing recharging when I first started wearing it. Now it will only last one day before needing recharging, regardless of how much I'm using it. I've turned off the notifications and such. Maybe I just have bad luck with these things. :-( I enjoyed the clock on the face and the pulse/steps/calories burned features. Everyone thinks it's an Apple IWatch.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|December 28, 2016|Great fitness tracker. Not such a great smart watch.|I had my Blaze for 9 months. I have it paired with my GS7 It worked really well for the first two months.After that my incoming calls wouldn't display anymore. I would reboot the device, disable and enable the feature, I even deleted the and re downloaded the fitbit app. Which it will work for the first two calls then back to square one. If you are looking for a smart watch just stick to an actual smart watch like the Galaxy Gear or an Apple watch if you have an iPhone. The fitness features work well but for that you might as well save some money and just get the Charge HR.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 28, 2017|Poor Battery Life but nice watch|Battery life is fair! I have to charge this watch once every 2 days! If i had to buy it again I would go with the fitbit charge 2. Its no good if you can't use all the features and keep the battery life. You have to shut all of the features off to keep the battery life sufficient. I don't use any of the extra features because I will have to charge it daily if I do.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|February 6, 2017|I like the call and text features|I had to purchase this for a fitness course that I took in high school. I don't have the rash problem that so many people were talking about on here, however I made sure not to wear it while it was wet or while I was wet, so that may have something to do with that. I like the call and text features, but I hardly use them. My grandma on the other hand uses them all of the time. My absolute favorite feature (and the only reason I still wear the watch) is the silent alarm. I've always hated a loud, blaring alarm sound and this alarm feature on this watch wakes me up much happier than the loud alarm on my phone. My biggest problem with this watch is the fact that most of the time in order to get it to sync to my phone I have to shut down the watch and turn it back on.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|January 3, 2017|Amazing Product- when it is working correctly.|Positives: FitBit Blaze provides much more accurate numbers when you are counting calories because it gives you real time updates even when you are sitting still.  The design is beautiful and very appealing to look at.  If you are not running a constant sync with your phone, the battery lasts me 3-4 days per charge which is a huge plus on smart watches.  The HR monitor seems very accurate when comparing it to a manual test. Negatives:  I have had this product for just over a month and I am constantly plagued with sync issues with my iPhone.  I am extremely tech savvy, so I can't imagine how frustrating it would be for someone who is not.  There was a week straight where even when I would go through the troubleshooting process, it would not sync.  This doesn't seem like a deal breaker, but if the battery runs out, there is no way to display the correct time without syncing it! (You can sync it to the computer, but I think that defeats the purpose of the bluetooth functionality.)  My only solution has been to delete the app, make the iPhone "forget" the device, and restart from scratch.  I've had to do this probably 7-8 times in the past 4 weeks.  I haven't heard any issues with other phones, but if over the next week I continue to have syncing issues, I will be returning this product.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|December 24, 2016|Great for exercise not for text|So I wanted something to keep track of my steps.  I work at Amazon and we walk A LOT! but I was looking for something that could also receive text.  Since there are no phones allowed in the facility I wanted something where my husband could send a text if something was wrong at home.  Texting does not work unless your phone is nearby.  Great for exercise not for text, apps or anything else.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|7|June 22, 2016|Good "watch" with inaccurate useless features but hey the clock works!|I'm on my 3rd fit bit (2surge and 1 blaze) Friend of mine is an EMT so I figured I'll check how accurate heart monitor was against a real heart monitor.. Well it was off by at least 10-20 bpm. So when it comes down to accuracy that's out the window so is pedometer if you're active e.g.. Pushing a grocery count if your wrist is not moving your not getting your steps....(that's why I never win weekly step challenges against my friends :-P ) The "quick view" feature on the blaze is worse than the one on the Surge bearly picks up my wrist motion to where I end up pressing the side button..really frustrating especially when you are in the middle of running and want a quick peek on your time. Battery life is much better than my Surge and I feel as it's less bulky. I wish fit bit came out with more face display designes but I'm being picky at this point. If you want it as nothing else as a watch then it's not a bad purchase, being that it's cheaper than the surge and has a color screen blaze is no brainer. I like how I can customize bands by 3rd party companies.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|April 27, 2017|Neat tech, but...|I purchased my Blaze here on Amazon in November 2016, and I've been using it daily since then.  I upgraded from a Fitbit Charge HR, and after using the Blaze for awhile, I think I could have saved my money and kept the Charge.  Don't get me wrong, the Blaze is cool tech, but the reason I upgraded was really to be able to get email and text notifications on the Blaze.  It does provide that option, but it's really more annoying than useful.  I can read texts on the screen, while email notifications are just the sender and subject, which is fine. Call notifications are helpful too, but a lot of the time when I get a call notification, my Blaze doesn't start buzzing until the call has already gone to voice mail and by then I've missed it.  But, my biggest disappointment is that the text/email notification option is pretty much useless because the Blaze doesn't differentiate between new notifications and ones it's already given me.  So, I get some notifications and acknowledge them by either swiping them away or pressing "Clear All," but then when I get new notifications, all of the ones I already acknowledged come back too, so this feature isn't very useful.  You can also control music on your phone (start, pause and stop play), and I use that occasionally.  I love the styling of the Blaze and it looks good on, but because it was pretty expensive compared to the Charge HR, I am almost hesitant to use it while exercising because it gets sweaty and dirty!  Overall, I like it, but for what I can use it for, I could have kept my Charge HR.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 4, 2017|Battery won't hold a charge after 3 months of use.|I do like this Fitbit Blaze, but the battery has started draining within 6 hours after every charge. I don't think I can return it at this late date, but is there a way to have the battery replaced? This FitBit is pretty handy, though it doesn't notify me of any messages or calls even after I've set it up to do so. It does pretty good with tracking my activity and I like the feature that will take you through a workout that you choose on the Fitstar app. Other than the battery and the lack of notifications, I like it. But if I were to give stars for performance, I would give it a 2.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|July 21, 2017|Battery issue not resolved|Would not recommend until fitbit irons out all the problems.  Main issue seems to be the battery.  It last about half the time as advertised.  Hence, your recharging every two days.  My blaze actually reached the point where it could not be recharged at all.  This was within the first six months of ownership.  Now Fit bit did send me a replacement promptly but this only indicates they were aware of the Blaze battery issue.  Personally, they rushed production in order to hit the retail sector.  Nice watch but again it suffers badly with the battery.  Not recommended at this time.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|1|July 7, 2017|It is a good product but there are some issues syncing with the ...|It is a good product but there are some issues syncing  with the iphone. I have a surge with no issues. But the blaze? just don't know.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|October 15, 2016|OK, but...|It's ok but has some irritating quirks.  The heartbeat is not accurate, especially during workouts (I'm 55, it regularly shows my rate at peak 160 plus rates for 1-2 hours).  The count for going up stairs and up hills is very inaccurate, unlike my Fitbit One which died after 18 months which was very accurate.  Another irritant is the delay to wake up when I turn my wrist towards me to see what time it is.  The battery does not last nearly as long as promised if you use it to track exercise. Finally, you're supposed to be able to tap it twice to wake it up - seldom works.  I can live with all of these for now, but I doubt I'll get a new one when this one dies or recommend it to anyone unless they can fix these pt.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 23, 2017|Good tracker, but the Home Button Stopped Working|I enjoy wearing the Blaze primarily because of the watch face and menu item selections; however, the back button stopped working after less than one year.  Now I avoid selecting menu items because I can't get back to the home screen unless I plug the gadget into the charger.  Hope they make the buttons better.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|2|August 2, 2016|Please improve day-time readability|I bought the Blaze for my 84-year-old mother because I knew she would enjoy tracking her steps from day-to-day and tracking her heart rate.  The only reason I did not give it 4 stars instead of 3 is that I purchased the Blaze specifically because the clock face is large and easy to read. Unfortunately, during the day tha background on the face of the watch is yellow with white lettering -- making it difficult to read. I've tried to give this feedback to the company but find it impossible to communicate with someone to request a solution or to request an improvement.
B019VM3F2M|3.0|0|August 30, 2017|Go for the Garmin or Under armour or anyother big names equivalents.|Typical Fitbit hype. Battery lasts half as long as claimed, if that long. Screen is very dark. Band is HORRIBLE! You have to break it down to charge it. This is my 3rd and last Fitbit product. They consistently have terrible quality, although good.customer service hence the 2 stars. I would rather have a good quality fitness tracker and not have to use the customer service.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|February 4, 2017|We both loved them. Almost to the date at 1 year ...|Bought two of these for my wife and myself. We both loved them. Almost to the date at 1 year old the both died. For 200 expect watch to last longer than that. Now need to get a different kind and all the connections I had set up (my fitness pal, webmd, etc) are lost or take the chance on 200 dollars for 1 year of use. Not real happy. Update: customer service through chat and they are replacing both devices. Very happy they stand by the product so moving the rating from 1 to 4. After all they both did break just short of a year. Maybe should be a 3 but so happy with ease of customer service adding a star for that.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|2|July 12, 2016|Back to the Fitbit community|I had the Fitbit HR before but it gave me a rash within 3 weeks of use, so I had to return it.  I'm now giving Blaze a try.  5 weeks in, and so far so good.  When I re-activated my Fitbit account, I realized how much I missed the community.  A number of my co-workers also use Fitbit, so we get to keep each other accountable.  I do find that having a fitness tracker provides added motivation to move... if I'm a a few hundred steps away from the goal, I'd try to walk more to hit it.  I also like the sleep tracking, to help me identify patterns, so I can make adjustments to lifestyle in order to get more restful sleep.  Will check in later to update the review.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|June 28, 2017|After a rough start happy with purchase|Unfortunately the first watch that arrived was defective and after only wearing for a couple of days the battery died and would not charge.  Fortunately I called FitBit and explained the issue and they immediately sent a replacement.  The process while annoying since I wanted to begin using the FitBit immediately is why I am giving 4 starts.  Ever since receiving the replacement I have been enjoying getting to know and use the tracking capabilities on the FitBit.  I also like how this model looks.  It works well and looks good.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|July 4, 2017|good watch, after walking for a while I noticed ...|good watch, after walking for a while I noticed it made my wrist sweat, but that's to be expected. charging is decent, syncing is lame though, its slow, and when doing it manually it almost refuses to about 70% of the time.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|June 30, 2017|More functional as a fitness tool than as a everyday watch|Solid piece of gear that performs as advertised, but doesn't quite meet what were admittedly very high expectations. More functional as a fitness tool than as a everyday watch. Text and call notifications are nice, but not the reason I bought it. Pros: battery - lasts ~5 days on a charge and recharges quickly; watch-based HR and sleep monitors are helpful tools in tracking overall fitness (although I'm not convinced they're particularly accurate); easy to use and understand online "dashboard" (activity log). Cons: main con is a big one for me...instead of just raising/moving the watch--or even tapping the screen--and having the face wake up, I generally (90% of the time) have to push a button just to see what time it is, how much time has elapsed in my workout, or how much time I have left; generic "workout" tracking is questionable - I have to laugh when I mow the yard and am credited with a 45 minute "outdoor cycling" workout.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|January 10, 2017|Awesome product, Be careful when you update it|I really like this fitbit, it has a ton of band options, keeps me moving, notifies me of calls/text, and keeps me up to date with constant reminders of how out of shape I'm in (i.e. the fact that my heart rate goes into fat burning mode after walking up a flight of stairs).  Unfortunately for me, after about a month of use I received a notification that I should update my fitbit. I updated and it failed, however there was some sort of glitch and the screen wouldn't work.  I will say fitbit customer service is excellent and they tried to walk me through everything to reset it. It ended up not working and they offered to replace. I sent it in a couple weeks ago and should receive my replacement soon. Bottom line, I would recommend this product. If something goes wrong they will make it right. I wish the replacement process went a little faster but they are replacing it, so I really shouldn't complain.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|April 21, 2017|I love the fitbit|I love the fitbit. I love seeing messages while at work. I bought a separate charging station so I don't have to take out the screen to charge it. Definitely don't leave it charging longer than it needs because it will kill the battery. I love working out and knowing how efficient I'm being. The new sleep feature that they released even tells you your sleep cycles so you can track how much rest you're getting.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|April 28, 2017|which looks even more like a watch|It does everything you expect from a Fitbit. For the price, however, Fitbit will have to start thinking about waterproofing. The competition is really starting to give Fitbit a run for the money. Compared to the Garmin 230 and the Withing, which looks even more like a watch, this product leaves somewhat to be desired. However, Fitbit has a better online community for challenges with friends and family. If you don't care about that though, then check out some of the other options.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|March 4, 2016|Good, but could have been better.|Got my Fitbit Blaze and overall it is a good watch for the price. Like the clarity and ease of dashboard...it is designed quite well. It will take a while to completely understand all the ins and out. At the onset it is fairly intuitive to get it going except was and is tough to understand what all the buttons do....no where is explained in the accompanying collateral. Also, there is no watch face available that shows a seconds hand or value. I hope the company can come up with one. I know it will make it more useful and open more doors for sales. My daughter who is in the medical profession, I think it is a must for her to have a watch that has a seconds count while she works. She liked the Blaze so much, wanted to buy another one, but did not for the lack of seconds hand on any of the watch faces.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|July 23, 2017|Functional and stylish.|As far as fitness trackers go, I find the Fitbit Blaze to be both functional and stylish.  In addition to acting as a pedometer, it also will take phone and text notifications and has a heart rate monitor that helps track calories burned and heart rate.  I find it interesting to see what my heart rate during different times of the day and it's superior to the Alta in recognizing workouts.  From reviews I've read, the HR monitor is fairly accurate though your mileage may vary and I do not take it as gospel. The major drawbacks that I've noticed so far are that my right wrist keeps getting a rash.  My left wrist does not react in the same way, so I'm not sure what's going on.  Additionally, I find the sleep tracker a bit inaccurate since when I feel I sleep better it says I've slept worse.  I sometimes have insomnia and it doesn't recognize the time I'm lying in bed trying to fall back asleep as my being awake. But as a way to move more and track activity, I do recommend the Blaze.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|2|March 12, 2016|Worth every penny!|I must say that this watch is pretty slick.  Not a lot of extras but everything you need in a fitness tracker.  I own a gym and am recommending our clients purchase fit bit products.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is the extra step involved in getting to some of the info.  for example, depending on the screen, you will have to tap a couple of times to see your heart rate, when you are not exercising.  Overall, great product and worth buying.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in keeping track of daily stats and real time exercise stats.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|July 29, 2016|Be careful what you wish for!|I got my Fitbit Blaze working with a little trouble and a lot of technical help from Fitbit, but not much more than usual, given my modest status in the tech world. The Fitbit Blaze has  an amazing range of possibilities for the keep fit/keep healthy enthusiast but the key thing is to be sure, before you make the purchase, that you really want that much technology or are you actually just looking for a watch with some wrinkles, because the price is high (around $180). What bothers me increasingly is that there is also a considerable loss of your privacy if you set up the Fitbit to its full capability, because you have to enable the Fitbit to communicate the data it collects on you ("sync" it) to your account and your account can be accessed by Fitbit. I personally have concluded that I don't need all this technology but that was my mistake not Fitbit's, which is a very helpful company, its technical support is excellent and its online manual first-class.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|2|March 7, 2016|Job gets done|I just got my Fitbit Blaze and right away there are few things I believe are more of a nuisance and can be looked into to make it more effective for its users. First, there is nothing that tells you what needs to be done and I am not a psychic to know looking at a watch that says fitbit.com/setup under an arrow that I need to go online to that web address. A note or a small card containing step by step directions would be really helpful for users who aren't into tech stuff. I like the interface and how easy it was to sync it up to an online account once established. Again, would be nice if I was told I had to open an account. It's pretty neat once you get through minor hiccups initially. I wouldn't mind just a tad bit bigger screen and a better touch experience. However this gets the job done. So overall, it justifies the price, expected quirks, and room to improve. Definitely worth it when compare to Apple Watch
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|March 6, 2017|Great product - but no instructions|I would've given a 5-star review but the product doesn't come with any instructions. I had to look up how to set up the product online and I have to continue to look the product up to find out different features and how to use those features. There were no instructions on how to remove the face of the watch from the band - I didn't even know it was removable until it popped out.  There were no instructions on how to charge the face either.  I figured it out from trial and error.  However, regarding the product itself, it's fantastic! I love that it keeps track of walking steps, climbing steps, miles, calories burned, alarms to remind me to eat, exercise routines, shows me my heart rate and so much more! I am a pre-diabetic and with that comes some out of the ordinary instructions to stay healthy and not cross over to full diabetes. I can log my food intake and the nutritional value as well.  You do have to download the app on your cell phone and some of the features do require you to log them on the app on your phone and not the watch.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|August 26, 2016|Easy to use fitness tracker and old-fashion watch.|PROS:A watch with some interchangeable apps.  I love how you can't get lost in it.  Sleeper cycle tracker is so very helpful as well as the activity options.  I ordered my activities based on frequency of use and easily switch them whenever I need too.  I get excited to see the steps go up throughout the day and find myself more aware of my hourly movements. Clean lines and bold style - I can wear it with anything in my closet and look forward to getting a leather band for it. CONS: I don't 'love' it because it can't get wet like a standard athletic watch.  Chasing a toddler around - I could use a little more durability. And as a deep sleeper, I don't feel the vibrations as a morning alarm, I wish it had a chime feature or a stronger vibration.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|August 18, 2017|Best of Both Worlds|Having had both a fitbit flex in the past as well as an original Moto 360 smart watch; this hands down is the best of both worlds! I'm very impressed with the quality of the watch and the battery life (so far I'm getting about 3 days with heavy use and notifications).  I was very surprised at how comfortable the stock band is; I didn't think I'd be able to sleep with it on, but it's actually not really noticeable.  The charger is a bit janky and it sucks you have to take the tracker out of the frame/band to charge it.  Also the notification syncing for (atleast for Android) seems a bit wonky, they show up fine on the tracker, but don't sync when dismissed on one device or the other. Another positive is that an aftermarket frame/band can really upgrade the look of your tracker.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|August 1, 2017|vast improvement over Charge HR|Previously had the Fitbit Charge HR, and for a nominal upcharge (I paid $140 for this, and $130 for the Charge HR), this is a WAY better tracker.  A few of the things I liked best about this model: 1. the separation between the unit and the band - the reason I had to throw away my Charge HR was because the band separated from the unit, which made the whole thing useless, even though the electronic piece still worked fine.  With the Blaze, a broken band can be easily replaced, and there are lots of 3rd party sellers out there so the bands are cheap 2. lots more functionality - different watch layouts, ability to choose exercise modes, call/text/email notifications, etc. 3. you get a touchscreen interface The only feature this unit doesn't have that I want is true waterproofing - I wish I could swim with it and feel secure that it won't break, but I don't want to take that $140 risk.  Like with any heartrate trackers in this price range, some people will complain that the heartrate monitoring isn't super accurate, but I think those folks expect too much from a product in this price range.  Last comment - unfortunately, my Blaze died after 6 months, but Fitbit's customer support was awesome, and made it super easy to request a replacement.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|September 21, 2016|I like it much better than the Surge|I had a Surge but got tired of the constant rash despite following the fitbit "skin care" guide, so decided to try out the Blaze.  I like it much better than the Surge, but apparently fitbit didn't learn their lesson from the many many complaining users and appear to have used the same band material.  I switched over to an off brand leather band which I love.  While I think the Blaze is a 5 star, knocking a star off as a product that costs this much and has had so many complaints should have a band that doesn't cause so many skin issues.  I am really not sure who the fitbit dermatologists are, but maybe a new group needs to be consulted.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|2|May 17, 2016|Pretty nice, but still needs work.  It's about the best there is now, 2016.|Much better than the fit bit HR.  Longer battery life, large dial, more sensitive to footsteps. Still, it doesn't register walking while pushing a shopping cart with your left hand.  Somewhat inaccurate on stairs, especially if you hold the banister with the watch hand. Still, better than the others I've heard about.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|June 6, 2016|One thing I recommend for any of the fit bits is to go ...|Enjoying it alot.  Using it to connect with other friends trying to move more.  The heart rate monitor is really helpful for me which is why I went with this model.  I saw someone else wearing it who showed me the extra features and since I do not normally wear a watch most folks don't know it is a fitbit at first look.  One thing I recommend for any of the fit bits is to go into settings and choose your own step goal.  The application defaults to 10K steps which for me is about 4 miles.  I know a bunch of folks that stopped using theirs because they got discouraged by the 10k.  Set your own goal and you may be much happier with the product long term.  I put mine at 5K and find it is just enough to get me out for a walk at night to finish off the goal.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|May 22, 2017|I'll admit I did feel something like tingling numbness|I purchased this somewhat hesitantly after reading reviews about the mysterious pain and tingling from some users. I charged it for about 4 hours before wearing to make sure that it was at 100%. When I first put it on, I'll admit I did feel something like tingling numbness, or possibly even a TENS unit. The pain stayed local to the area around the watch for maybe half a day, and then faded into kind of an ache that also presented in my shoulder. I can only think this has something to do with the way I carry my arm now, even though I wear it with my dominant arm. Regardless, I got it on Saturday and was wearing it all Saturday evening and Sunday, and as I write this review Monday afternoon I have no pain or soreness. I noticed the watches band is silicone, so when I sweat it tends to stick to me and is hard to remove. Battery life seems to be average, I predict based on my percentage now it will last till Thursday mid day. I purchased an Apple Watch series 2 previously, and miss the water resistance, but other than that it does exactly what I want it to do without the other tech distractions (like my apps) from the Apple Watch.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|March 7, 2017|a good option|This product is great. it does one important thing in my opinion, and that is that it keeps you active. because of this watch i am self-conscious of when i am being lazy on an specific day. to ear extra step i park further away when every i go out. i have walked around the neighborhood for hours listening to music because i was behind on my steps for the day. two things that i do not like that might be a deal breaker for some people are 1 - that it cannot be submerge as per the review that i have seen on you tube. so no showering or swimming with it. 2 - the charging device feels like it might break easily, thankfully they have a lot of option in amazon for replacements. my review of a good product is this. if it breaks, i will buy it again.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|December 19, 2016|Great product, too bulky for me|I will preface this by saying I am returning the Fitbit Blaze but not due to any problems! I've had the Fitbit one for 3 years now and finally decided I deserved an upgrade! I wanted one that would double up as a watch and get notifications from my phone so the blaze seemed like the perfect fit. I have M/L wrists so I thought it would be fine. The reason I decided to return it was it's just a little too big for my taste so I'm going to go with the Charge HR2. With all of that being said, the blaze itself is awesome! I love getting the notifications from my phone so I feel like I can walk away for it for long periods of time but not miss anything important. I really love that it also measures your heart rate and you can adjust your settings to whatever workout you are doing. If you don't mind a really big watch then this is a great choice!
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|December 5, 2016|Pluses and minuses|I purchased this as a replacement for my Fitbit One and a basic smart watch. I had to uninstall and reinstall the Fitbit app on my phone to get it to connect the first time, but since then haven't had an issue. Getting phone notifications took me a while to figure out, as the Blaze showed as connected through Bluetooth but I wasn't getting the notifications. It was a simple solution (on the Blaze, under settings, Bluetooth classic had to be on then I could find it with my phone) and now notifications and syncing are working great. The downsides I've found are in tracking steps. If I'm grocery shopping and holding the cart, steps are not tracked. However, if I'm driving and have that hand on the bottom part of my steering wheel, steps are tracked. On a positive note, the heart rate matched the one on the treadmill (from their sensors) and also on the stationary bike. The distance for the treadmill was really close, though calorie burn estimates weren't. Of course, the weight I entered in the treadmill was accurate & I haven't recently updated my weight with Fitbit which could account for at least some of the difference.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|May 30, 2016|Really like the tracking capabilities of the Fitbit Blaze|Really like the tracking capabilities of the Fitbit Blaze, heart rate, steps, stairs and sleep to name a few. It's a sharp looking watch, I also purchased a silver wrist band to go with the black. The battery isn't the longest lasting, this lasts for about three days, but the charging of the device is simple, poop it out of the wrist band and into the charger, charge complete within a couple of hours. The only real complaint that I have, besides the relatively short battery life ( I have had a Fibit Charge and a Pebble, both have charges lasting about five days) is the watches notice/alarm vibration.  This device, when compared to my two previous devices, has a vibration that does the job but can be easily missed if you're preoccupied.  You knew when the alarms/vibration on my previous devices were going off, this one is not as noticeable. Still a very nice device.  I would recommend its purchase.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|May 11, 2016|Buy this watch TODAY!!!|I bought the Fitbit blaze on the reco on a friend who had the other Fitbit watch with the electrics integrated into the band, which he had to replace once or twice due to the band cracking over time. The blaze has not disappointed one bit. It tracks steps, syncs easily with my phone,, the only issue I have, and it is a small one, is that when I hold the handrails on the treadmill, it does not track my steps as well, c'est la vie. The band is great, it holds a charge for roughly 5 days. I did forget my charger while traveling, and an aftermarket charger was available on Amazon and it shipped quickly enough to arrive before my battery went dead. This has been a great addition to my workout regimen.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|July 7, 2017|List all the things you want from a fitness tracker first before choosing this one, lots of alternatives to this one|Seems to be more accurate than the other cheaper Fitbit Products.  You can't just shake your hands or wrist to get the steps. If you don't really care for the looks especially the watchfaces, I'd recommend the Alta HR or Charge 2 as you get the same technical stuff for the cheaper price.  The extra $50 (compared to the Charge 2) on the long run didn't really feel like a good value.  Music control and Notification didn't seem to be all that great especially if it doesn't want to work. The customization of the looks was bleak and the "watch" look got old.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|2|December 19, 2016|I like it but there are a couple set backs.|First of all, love this Fitbit. I wear it every day almost all day. Positives: -tells you where to improve -helps you reach your goals -comfterble -it looks nice Cons: -the metal scratches VERY easy. -it is not waterproof -dust and dirt shows very easy. -seems just a bit inaccurate. Overall, I do love this Fitbit and would choose this one over any of the others.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|July 15, 2016|Great watch for people who track their activities and sleep|I really like this smartwatch. I was mainly looking for an exercise/activity tracker that can also serve as a watch. Apple watch was too expensive and I recently made a switch to Galaxy S7 Edge, so I decided to go with the Fitbit Blaze. The most amazing feature is that it tracks your sleep automatically so you can just wear it after you shower at night and just fall asleep. It will automatically log your sleep data and sync it with your computer/phone/tablet. Only "flaw" of this watch, in my opinion, is that it is not water proof. This is a watch that I wear to the gym everyday and I wish I didn't have to take it off prior to showering and I wish I could wash my hands freely without worrying about getting too much water on this thing. Other reviews suggest, however, that one can wear this device in shower. I have not yet tried that myself.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|March 10, 2016|I'm very glad I decided to get this|As someone who was teetering between getting an Apple Watch and the Blaze, I'm very glad I decided to get this...So far I'm really enjoy it and it has all the fitness options I want without feeling like I'm connected to my cell phone all the time. The charge indeed DOES last about 5 days which I though was impressive and true to what the box said about it. I've gotten many comments on the sleekness of it, and personally I don't think it's any more bulky than a normal watch. Eventually I'll get a more casual band but I love the black one! Great product and I recommend it for anyone who's extremely active or looking for a nice fitness watch.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|2|March 3, 2016|It works great after you learn how to use it|Using the blaze with galaxy s6 edge. It works great after you learn how to use it. Two issues I have with it is it tends to respond rather slow sometimes. The other issue is the audio control sometime works. I found that disconnecting it from Bluetooth and reconnecting it would resolve the issue. FYI: text and call notification works fine on my phone but a friend using a nexus told me the notification does not always work and when making a phone call, the blaze will show that he is receiving a call from the person he is trying to call.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|2|August 24, 2016|It is a very useful workout tool and is pretty accurate with the readings|The fitbit blaze has worked well so far.  It is a very useful workout tool and is pretty accurate with the readings.  I have cleaned the wristband each night after use and have not run into any rash problems.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was because there are only 4 different watch faces to choose from and the battery only lasts a few days.  Other than that, this was a good investment for the price.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|April 25, 2017|One downside|I absolutely love the Surge along with the band style/size and the color. I did upgrade and this seems to suit my wants/needs better than my previous Fitbit. The previous two bands had separated/pulled away at the screen. I  submitted my first under the warranty...then the replacement gave me issues as well. This band isnt connected in the same way. I feel it was due to my wrist being in between the small and large only size options. ONE downside to this band is that I'm getting color transfer from my clothing and/or keyboard so it's starting to look dingy. I will be purchasing some off market bands to replace it!
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|May 3, 2017|When it syncs, it's great|I've had this Fitbit now for at least 6 months.  I really like it, but the one thing that drives me crazy is that it's hit or miss when you go to sync it to your phone.  It will sync fine, then for some reason it won't sync no matter what you do.  I usually have to delete the watch and add it new to trick the phone into thinking it's new...and this usually works.  As with most technology, I think Bluetooth needs to be replaced with something more reliable.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|March 13, 2017|Good for the money.|Good watch and exercise tracker. Notifications does not function very well with my apple 5. Reboot gets it going but then when phone out of range it quits again. Restart will get it going again. No where near the functions of the Apple Watch but no where near the price either
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|September 12, 2016|A Work in Progress|This is a good product which could be great.  Fitbit owners are people who are interested in tracking their fitness regimes.  Many of us like to swim and this product is not waterproof; I am not talking about SCUBA but surface swimming such as in a pool.  I swim laps for an hour three times a week and cannot track my progress for this period.  I like being able to easily track my activities, particularly my heart rate as I am recovering from open heart surgery.  Another reason for my less that top rating is that my Blaze is not as accurate as my Charge; I bought the Blaze to replace the Charge primarily due to its screen.  I know Fitbit has recently released Fitbit Flex 2 which is waterproof but it does not have a screen so that one can easily monitor the workout results; therefore I will not buy it.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|2|May 4, 2016|Replacement for my Charge HR and Pebble Watch|I had a Fitbit Charge HR and a Pebble Watch.  I upgraded to the Blaze in order to have everything on one device.  I have been reasonably happy, but there are a few functions that the Pebble performs better than the FitBit.  The vibration motor on the Pebble is much stronger than the one on Blaze.  I have a hard time noticing it when I am awake and there is no way the Blaze vibration alarm would wake me up.  The notifications function is not as reliable and full featured as the Pebble was, but that is a software issue that hopefully will be fixed soon.  Bottom line is that when I decided to go to one device, I knew that my choices were a smart watch that has added fitness tracking or a fitness tracker that has added smart watch functionality. I decided that I thought fitness tracking was more complex and more important to me and went with the Fitbit Blaze.  I am betting that it will be easier for Fitbit to upgrade the smart watch functionality to compete with the Pebble than it will be for Pebble to upgrade to match the Fitbit tracker functionality.  I am happy with the Blaze as my one device choice, but I am anxiously awaiting software updates from Fitbit.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|June 14, 2016|Great investment|This was a huge impulse buy, but I'm glad I did it. Lots of great features beyond the usual step/calories/time aspects. As a student nurse, I take my Fitbit with me on the unit (after cleaning it) and I use the stopwatch feature to take vitals. I love the plum band and that the watch allows me to specify whichever type of exercise I'm currently doing (elliptical, treadmill, running, etc) to get maximum accuracy. Also really enjoy the FitStar workouts available on the watch, although I wish there were more than just a few to choose from. Cons: Although I fit the watch to my wrist as per the instructions, the back of the watch face  keeps abrading my skin and causing redness and irritation. If I secure the band any looser it's much too loose for accuracy. I also find it exceedingly difficult to clean.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|August 29, 2016|Meets expectations.|It seems to be everything it says it is. It does pair with an Apple 6 phone and it is used to record activity, heart rate, and sleep analysis.  It is used to check incoming text messages and it can be recharged without difficulty.  The Blaze has a nice appearance and the case and strap can be changed. Like most new electronic products, it does take time to learn how to use it.  Getting started can take some time but if you have had an electronic smart watch before it will be learned quickly.  Someone with no experience could require help to get started.  I gave this watch to my wife and not being computer smart, she has learned to enjoy the watch.  Excellent choice.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|7|December 31, 2016|Easy and convenient|Works good so far, just hooked my Blaze up for its first charge. It didn't register as charging at first. I took it off and stuck the bottom in first, then pressed the top Blaze button before sliding into place on the charger base, then the blaze showed the charging logo. I like this base because it seems preferable than unclicking the Blaze Watch face every time to close in charging cord.. better to just place it on a base then just pop it off an continue wearing when done charging.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|July 3, 2017|Great for working out|I wanted a smatwatch that had a heartrate monitor, sleep tracking and would not need to be charged every day. This one fits the bill. Notifications are still a little off sometimes and do not come in right away. Over all it's a good smartwatch for the price and what it does.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|May 10, 2016|Cheaper Alternative to iWatch...|So this was a gift for my mom for Mother's Day. And while, I am pretty decently versed in many different technological devices, setting up the Blaze was initially very challenging without actual directions being provided in the box. I had to look online to figure out how to set it up. This was particularly necessary because for whatever reason, setting up on my mom's iMac just was not working. For some reason, the iMac did not recognize whether the Blaze's Bluetooth was turned on and the Blaze was not helpful because it kept saying log into the fitbit website for set up. *For the record, I knew the iMac's Bluetooth was in working order because both the keyboard and the mouse are wireless and I was actively using them.* It was much easier to set it up on her iPhone via the Fitbit app. While the Blaze does not have all the snazzy effects of the iWatch, it does have some of the same things as the iWatch, most notably, the Blaze will notify you when you have phone calls (even when your phone is on silent). You can also read text messages off the Blaze. My mom is definitely enjoying wearing it and being more aware of her day-to-day health and activity level, but she (i.e. me, in that less techie parent bugs more techie child to teach them about tech) is still learning how it works so I couldn't give it full marks.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|August 23, 2017|gift for my Husband|Stopped working/charging 30 days after my purchase and this was our second one. The first one didn't last 30 days either.  We thought that one had a defect so we returned it, but turns out this one didn't last much longer before its no good. I am so disappointed because My husband and I both loved our fit bits. I have a Charger 2 and have not had any problems at all with this model. It was promptly replaced with a new one and my husband and I still love out FitBit!
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|April 8, 2016|Great blue monster fitness watch|I have previously gone around with the surge and charge hr and while I liked them both ' I am enjoying the blaze even more. It is lighter than the surge and you can almost forget that its on your hand. I always have my phone with me so I don't miss not having a gps on the watch. The screen is ofcourse much more impressive and readable than the surge or charge and this watch can do many more actions than the limited screen on the charge you are able to pause the blaze during a run or walk which is something that cant be done on the charge. what don't I like: 1. It is very big and I don't especially like its shape 2. charging the watch is not easy and I am worried if the watch wont break with all the taking out and putting back in the body from its holder
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|December 10, 2016|Great but could be even better!|I really like  the Fitbit Blaze but I'm disappointed with Fitbit as a company for not listening to their customers more. Updating the software to be more customizable would be so easy.  I want to be able to set up interval training and other crossfit features without buying another Fitbit. The ability to just pop the Blaze out of the frame and into another is awesome - changing from a sporty look to a casual one or a more professional look takes seconds and it looks great. I would recommend getting a second setup of frame+bands for this though. And I don't know what I would've done without a screen protector - my wrist is constantly on the concrete or slapping against something when I work out- I have no idea how the rest of you manage to keep your unprotected fitbits from just exploding during a session =P
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|August 14, 2017|Love my Blaze|My FitBit Charge stopped keeping accurate time after using it for a year.  I tried out a Garmin and decided to go back to FitBit.  I love my Blaze and its interface.  It was easy to sync it with my existing app. However the wristband started reacting with my sweaty skin and leaving itchy bumps.  I had to replace the wristband; a small price to pay to keep using my FitBit.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|September 16, 2016|My review after owning this device for 1 year - 3.5 stars|Pros: 1) It has a touchscreen 2) more workout features than the previous Fitbit 3) The wristband is interchangeable Cons: 1) the touchscreen sometimes freezes and you have to wait a few seconds for it to start working again. The touchscreen is not as responsive as an iPhone or most Androids. 2) the altimeter sensor needs to be recalibrated as it does not accurately calculate my stair climbing. Many times I walk upstairs to the 2nd floor in my house and it does not input the data. I have a flight of 16 stairs. 3) not water resistant (but the new model is at a much higher price) 4) after using this for a year, I can say that the battery life lasts up to 3.5 days on a single charge if you are actively using this device every day. If you hardly touch this device while wearing it, it can last up to 5.5 days on a single charge.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|October 30, 2016|but I can say I am happy with this purchase|With how big this is it took a bit of getting used to wearing it, but I have worn it daily since buying it almost 5 months ago.  I have the app on my android phone and my tablet, and I have logged in to my account on my PC as well.  The app allows me to track a lot of different things, more than I actually use in fact.  Maybe some day I will get to the point of using all of the features.  It holds a charge well, I only recharge it once a week.  It does not have to update often thankfully.  The 5-10 minute update process took over 90 minutes to complete last week, and it was that long actually out of the box when I set it up too, but I have had zero problems with it since purchase.  This is the only fitness tracker I have owned, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say I am happy with this purchase.  A lower price would have been great of course, but it's been worth it so far.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|0|October 17, 2016|Dependable fitness watch with one caveat...|I've used this watch continuously since I bought it two months ago. Durability: The battery lasts for several days, long enough that it isn't a nuisance to take it off and charge it. Reliability: I've used it in several cases where I knew my heart rate was over 150 and it registered as below 135. Otherwise, it seems accurate. Comfort: It feels like any other watch. No discomfort when worn regularly for extended periods. I only take it off to shower and recharge. Features: I mainly use it for monitoring heart rate, but I bought it specifically to record my sleep habits. The record of minutes and number of times restless and awake at night help me know if I need to change something in my habits. Overall: I think this watch would be excellent if it worked for high-intensity exercise with peak heart rate levels.
B019VM3F2M|4.0|1|December 20, 2016|Good Product, great app, big user community, and good chat tech support|I've had my Blaze for almost a year now, and I've loved it. until...  About 6 weeks ago the charge went from lasting ca. 4 days to 1 day. I contacted support via e-mail and they told me to do the things posted on their website about not properly charging even though it was clear to me the most likely cause was a faulty battery/short between the cells.  But I figured I could live with it since it still lasted a day.  Then last night when I plugged it in to charge, and the battery icon showing it was charging didn't come on, and this morning it is completely dead.  I contacted support via their chat client and within 10 mins I had an email to get a replacement device shipped to me for free.  *Happy Dance*
B019VM3F2M|5.0|2|July 11, 2016|Slightly Obsessed|After having my FitBit Blaze for a few days, I LOVE IT.  It is way better than my FitBit Charge that I loved.  The screen is smooth with the touch screen, it snaps in and out easily enough, but its strong enough to hold it.  It fits great, looks great, isnt too big, and is SOOOO easy to use.  The connection to my phone is flawless and replacing the band for other colors is easy as well.  The notifications on it are definitely a huge plus.  You can read texts, see calls and answer them, see calendar things and more! The its great for working out as well. The battery is pretty decent, only needing charged every 4 or 5 days.  My only suggestion or wish is that you can get to the timing feature either quicker or you can just hold down one of the side buttons to start a timer.  I highly recommend!
B019VM3F2M|5.0|5|March 2, 2016|Blaze|I love the Blaze - great purchase. I like the Blaze over the Surge. The Surge was too masculine for my small wrist. The Blaze is a smaller frame than the Surge and works for everyday wear. The colors are nice and bright. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to have a "smart" fitness watch.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|August 6, 2016|Love it!  Helps keep me motivated|I have been using this daily for about 5 months and I love it.  I do have a smaller wrist, so it is a big large on me, but it is comfortable.  I do not have any sort of screen protector on it and I have yet to get one scratch. I love the fitbit software, and it keeps me motivated.  Myfitness pal can sync with fitbit, so it also helps to keep track of my calories all in one place.  I have found the heart monitor to be fairly accurate for not being a medical device.  I use it to see general trends in my activity level, sleep, and heart rate day  to day and works great for that purpose.  I have tested the workout function against my polar strap monitor, and both read very similar amounts of calorie burn, so it is plenty accurate for me to estimate how much I am burning during exercise.  I plan on buying some of the off-brand straps to make it look a bit more feminine--the only complaint I really have is that it does look a bit manly. I would definitely buy again
B019VM3F2M|5.0|4|March 10, 2016|Great Watch|Love it. I was looking for a replacement for the Surge because it gave me a rash due to the metal screws making contact with my skin. It sucks to be allergic to certain metals, and this was a good option. I had considered an Apple Watch, but I am glad I got this instead. I don't need to respond to anyone with my watch, I don't care to play with too many apps; I just wanted a device with some music control when I work out.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|3|May 3, 2016|Best smart watch (until someone untethers the phone from one)|A gift for my son, he absolutely loves it. It's nice looking, functional as a watch, and notifies him who is calling or texting so he doesn't have to look at his phone. Having a sedentary job, he also likes that it reminds him to move, even if it is just to stand and stretch. The Fitbit app keeps all his stats and is easy to use. He said he also finds himself taking flights of stairs to see his heart rate increase. If it gets him to move more, I say mission accomplished.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|July 18, 2017|Very satisfied with the Blaze|A lot of my family members have fitbits of some kind, so I decided to join in. I couldn't be more satisfied with Blaze. It's intuitive and easy to use, and has a ton of great features. The watch automatically tracks steps, distance, calories burned, floors climbed, heart rate, and has the capability to do even more beyond that. It can track sleep cycles, when you wake up in the middle of the night, when you wake up in the morning, and even calculate 30-day averages for sleep stages and total time spent asleep. You can also use the watch as a fitness tracker - running, walking, aerobic exercise, you name it and the Blaze can track it - except swimming. Though water resistant, it is not water proof, and that is one of only two downsides, the other being the lack of GPS tracking without connection to a phone. The watch wears comfortably, the strap is fairly easy to adjust, and I don't really have any complaints about it. You can also choose from a number of different interfaces on the watch screen, so you can make it appeal to your own personal taste. I definitely would recommend the Fitbit Blaze to anyone looking to go above and beyond with tracking daily activity.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|47|March 8, 2016|Better than AppleWatch|Couldn't be happier!  This is better than the AppleWatch.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|4|February 10, 2017|One of the best presents I have ever gotten|One of the best presents I have ever gotten. I love this thing. It never leaves my wrist (unless showering). I have lost 8 lbs in 4 weeks just walking and keeping track with this device. It's like a personal cheerleader that is always with you.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|July 16, 2017|Very Good Smart Watch|I never thought I would want or like a fitness watch.  Finally gave in and now I am hooked.  First it is nice watch where you can easily change bands and needs to be charged for a few hours every five days.  Synced to my iphone easily where I can monitor sleep patterns and much more.  It tracks heartbeat along with my movements or lack there of during the day.  You can even get text messages or alerted to calls on you phone as long as you are within bluetooth range.  There are many more functions.  No way to tell durability but if it lasts 2 years - I will be satisfied.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|July 11, 2016|Great Tool|This tool has helped me retrain my body and my lifestyle into something a lot more healthy. With the meal tracking, I taught myself what 1700-2000 calories a day looks like with healthy foods compared to bad ones. I now know I wasn't walking nearly as much as I previously thought. I know my sleep is pretty lousy and needs improving. All these pieces of knowledge are keys to getting healthy. Only issue I've had so far is with the stair stepping count being incorrect. Drove from Nashville, TN to MS and it said I climbed 100 flights of stairs. I know it's not 100% accurate, but is a great tool for weight loss. The battery lasts me about 2-3 days on a full charge, so it's pretty nice there also.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|January 18, 2017|Perfect upgrade|I have had a Fitbit Flex for a few years.  I finally decided to upgrade and am so happy that I did.This is a great upgrade.  I love that it includes a watch function.  I also am walking more throughout the day with the reminders every hour during the work day to walk.  It does well tracking exercise as well and I use it in tandem with my Orange Theory heart rate monitor.  It is built of tougher stuff then my flex and it has been charging so but better then the flex.  It last about 4 days for me on a charge.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|3|August 15, 2016|Goals are more easily accomplished with accountability|This Fitbit has changed my life. Goals are more easily accomplished with accountability, and this little gadget keeps me accountable to myself. I walk more and exercise more. I've lost 16 pounds since using it. It's keeping me on track, and I love it. I intend to use it for a very long time.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|April 12, 2017|great work out tool but get an andriod phone to use with it|This fitness watch is great IF you are not trying to use a windows phone or a windows PC the app is buggy as all get out almost non functional. My wife has a charge II and she uses a android based phone it works flawless. With windows you cant use the GPS from your phone you cant receive text alerts or call ID on your fitbit some of the time the app doesn't show all the info from the Blaze is very slow to update, all this is due to windows not being fully compatible right now anyway. They should tell you about the limitations when using a windows base phone, some time the app just closes for no reason or freezes very random, I'm using a windows 10 phone so most of the blame is on Microsoft,
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|December 3, 2016|Best watch on the market|The best product I have purchased all year. I absolutely love this watch/ fitness tracker. The app that runs with the blaze is really easy to use.  I love how it keeps up with all the stats for you on the app and watch.  I love everything about this watch coming from someone that is trying to get back in shape.  This is one tool I would recommend for anyone that is active and trying to get the best edge in training they can get.  Not to mention this watch just looks great and wears just as good,  I would also like to mention the step counter and heart rate monitor are on point. Unlike most step counter where you just move your arms and it counts as a step this one will only count actually steps. The heart rate is dead on as I have compared this to some of the heart rate machines that my facility nurses use in their work.  Again great product and if you got the money to purchase one I highly recommend it since this will be one the best items you buy if you use it properly.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|June 1, 2017|What can I say about this wonderful product!|What can I say about this wonderful product!!!!!  I just love it!!!!  It has made me health conscious.  I am determine to reach my goals.  One of them is the 10,000 steps a day.  I see myself trying to make more than that.  The water intake and the tracking of my sleep.  I am not sleeping as much as I use to and I noticed that since I use the FitBit, I am sleeping more than my coworkers do.  Because one of my coworker bought one and was using it for a couple of weeks, and she was loving the results, I decided to purchase one too.  We are just loving it.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|March 9, 2016|upgrading from the flex to the blaze was the best idea ever!|I decided that with my tax returns I would do something healthy for myself, and decided that upgrading from the flex to the blaze was the best thing to do. I was a little hesitant to do so because the difference in the sizes made me think that I would regret just how big the blaze was compared to the flex that I would never be able to get use to it. I did. Instantly. And I am absolutely in love with it! I love the color screen, and how you can change the clock face settings to show how active you have been minute to minute. The floors are accurate and I absolutly LOVE being able to see how many steps I have just by looking at my wrist. The fact that they have small workouts to get the blood pumping a swipe away is perfect, especially since it teaches you how to do each move. You are able to switch out the watch bands (something that swayed me to the flex) possible negatives: Checking texts is pretty awesome, but I wish that it was a little more interactive. Even if it means that you can just open up a larger text message to view all of it. The heart rate moniter seems to be a little high, even when I move the blaze up my wrist, as instructed by fitbit, it is not getting near what Im actually reading for my resting heart rate I wish there was a way to set a reminder that would go off if you are too sedentary, so that it pushes you more to move.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|14|April 1, 2016|Much better fit than the Charge HR!|I am amazed at how much more comfortable this is too wear vs the Charge HR.  It is bigger but not as tall and feels like a snug fitting watch.  If you are on the fence and thinking about purchasing one DO NOT WAIT!  Love the large color screen and how easy it is to set up.  I had the Blaze up and running in 5 minutes.  Only negatives which I knew before buying is it is not waterproof and the charger appears to be an afterthought. It is not hard to charge but just seems so unintuitive.  A magnetic charger like the Apple Watch would have been the better approach.  BTW I also have an Apple Watch that I gave to my son.  The Fitbit is a much better fitness device than the Apple Watch and that is from someone who loves Apple products.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|2|May 27, 2017|Shut up and give them your money!!!!|This is a nice little gadget to have if your trying to live a more active life. I love that I can track and graph my progress with the app as well. I've had my Blaze for a little over a month and I've lost 16lbs... It helps keep me moving and motivated! If you're thinking about buying this, just do it! You won't regret it. The app is amazing and easy to use. You can make "friends" and compete to get the most steps.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|May 24, 2017|Perfect for the Fitness Conscious|Bought this for my wife for our anniversary. Helps her to focus in on where her workouts are or are not efficient. The sleep monitoring function has been very telling, as she has discovered that her "restful" periods are not as they should be, and is allowing her to seek advice in order to improve her sleep. Had one small glitch with it months kitchen when some water got on the sensors. The screen kept flashing on and off rapidly. Quickly found the reset sequence via Google and have been glitch free for several months
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|March 3, 2016|I love the new blaze so far|I love the new blaze so far. Please know I am writing this within hours of using it, so I might update this review. I bought the surge in December 2014 and absolutely loved it and haven't gone a day without it, but I hated the bulky design and how the band would smell after high intensity cardio even with regular washing. The biggest thing I'm excited about is the interchangeable bands, especially when they start to stink. I'm not a runner or hiker so the GPS thing doesn't bother me at all. I do Insanity and Insanity max30, and this thing is pretty darn close with heart rate compared to chest strap monitors (also, virtually identical stats between the surge and the blaze, as I wore them both today during my workout). The new design is incredibly sleek and the photos do NOT do this product justice. It looks a lot bigger in photos than it does on your wrist, especially compared to the surge. It's smaller, better looking and has all the things you look for from Fitbit. Highly recommended :) (this is a size small and has significantly longer straps than the surge small size, and I don't have extra tiny wrists, so IOW, the blaze small is more like a surge large).
B019VM3F2M|5.0|3|February 16, 2017|GREAT WATCH!!|Ordered this for my husband because I love mine so much. I also ordered the Weight Guru scale to sync with our Fitbit app. So glad I did!! Between the watch and scale we're sure to keep our health in check at 73.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|4|May 1, 2016|The Blaze is awesome AND Amazon Customer Service ROCKS!|I absolutely love this fitbit! It is heads and tails above the flex in terms of features and functions. It really is just like the Apple Watch (as my husband has the Apple Watch) BUT it is a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, I lost it within the first three weeks of owning it! I was heartbroken and very upset with myself for losing it!  My husband suggested I call Amazon to see if they have a buyer protection program. I never thought in a million years they would replace the fitbit at no cost, but low and behold, they did! Amazon, you ROCK!
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|April 29, 2016|Who needs an iWatch?|This does everything the other FitBits do and more;  It has the few features I would want from the much more expensive iWatch (text alerts,music control, event reminders, call alert and control, silent alarms) and the display is very clear and legible.  Battery life is less than , say, the FitBit charge, but that is to be expected (I generally need to charge it every 3 days or so).  My only complaint is their proprietary charging cradle; I have to think they could fit a micro-usb charging port on the watch so you could charge on the go with  a generic cable, but instead you have this clunky cradle that is too big to carry around with you and, if you are traveling, pretty impossible to find as an accessory in an electronics store.  Fortunately, there are after market suppliers on Amazon that you can order them from, which I highly recommend, both as a backup and/or to have someplace at your job, so you can charge it during downtime, as between using it to track activity AND sleep, you need to find the downtime to charge it.  I'm also not a big fan of the silicone band (talk about a sweaty wrist), but again, there are a ton of aftermarket band options out there for reasonable prices.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|4|March 4, 2016|WOW! super impressed|this is SLICK!!!  so comfortable to wear and sync's with phone quickly and frequently.  LOVE the display and big numbers for my old eyes! So what it doesn't have GPS, what do you need a map of your run for anyway? IF you do need a map, it syncs with phone GPS easily enough. Love the little exercises and great sleep tracking. The website is very user friendly and easy to navigate. Had a garmin 235  and it would always lose connection with phone and wouldn't sync. Could this be any better!?!!? NO!!!
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|May 14, 2017|Absolutely love!|Bought this for my daughter. I personally thought it would be really big but once I took it out of the box it's not as big as you would think. It fit her wrist really well. She loves it. It's gotten her up and active. I have a fitbit too and she and I challenge each other constantly. She loves the text message options, she gets the entire text on the screen of her Blaze. Get screen protectors for the face though, she is constantly bumping it around and it has saved the face from getting damaged
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|January 28, 2017|Neat Little Fitness Watch|Works just as I expected it to, from telling me my steps and heart rate, right down to giving me notifications from Twitter, PSN and text messages. There are two things that are annoying and less of a deal breaker if you're currently on the fence on getting a Blaze. One, the wrist band is nice but it can be a bit of a pain in the butt when you want to take off your watch. The reason for that is the notches in the band (think of a belt). it'll stay secure on your wrist, but when you want to take it off you'll struggle a bit your first few times. The second minor annoyance is having to re-enable notifications to sync up with your phone. I occasionally find that notifications won't come to my Blaze even though they're enabled which would require me to go into the app, select notifications, turn off notifications and then turn them back on. Other than that this is a neat fitness watch that fulfills my needs.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|July 12, 2017|Best fitness band I've tried so far|I've owned several of the fitness watches over the years, and they've all had one thing in common.  The rubber on the band peels off from too much time outside in hot environments.  This watch has a lot of functionality, great battery life, is relatively water resistant, and, most importantly, you can get several different watch bands to go with it.  None of the other fitness bands that I've purchased managed to make it a year before I threw it in a drawer and got a new one.  This one is on track to make it until the battery will no longer hold a charge, hopefully a long time from now.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|January 25, 2017|Love my Blaze!|I love my Blaze, it's so cute and functional. I had a Charge HR before, and I love this one way more. I like the customization available with the watch face. You can change it to digital clock if you want, which I find very convenient. It's easier to start/stop workouts by swiping left and selecting workout on the touch screen, which is easier than remembering which combination of buttons to push on the HR. I bought a stand charger which makes charging it a lot less hassle, you don't have to take it out of the band if you purchase the stand charger rather than the charger it comes with, makes life easier. I bought my mom and dad Blaze's for Christmas and they LOVE them, they also love the fitbit app and the ability to be friends on the app and challenging and encouraging everyone. It's an awesome device.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|May 5, 2017|Love it!|This is an upgrade for me and I love it! I didn't find it difficult at all to learn how to charge it, set it up and use it. If you actually READ the instructions you will not have any issues. I think some of the reviews are a little misleading in that regard. The wrist band is comfortable for me, I don't notice it. What I liked most is that it transferred my old data so it's like I didn't miss a beat. I also like that it is is a truly customized device for you.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|2|March 2, 2017|Love it!|After buying three fitbit HR's this one seems like it will actually be around for a while. My problem with the HR's was always band related, this is easily remedied in this product, with a quick switch.  Love the features on this too
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|April 11, 2017|Motivation That I Can See|I had put off buying a Fitbit for several years, not seeing the value in them. Finally, I Decided that I wanted to keep track of where my heart rate was during the day and night so I bought the Fitbit purely for that but it has been so much more! I use it as a watch, as a motivation for getting 10,000 steps in a day and have challenges with my friends which has been so much fun. My fitness level has improved and even my sleep has improved because I saw when I was waking up and decided to make some changes before bedtime to help my sleep. The face is so easy to read and you can customize it to different faces to what works best for you. Would recommend anyone purchase a Fitbit!
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|June 26, 2017|Love..|Love.... my blaze. I have had 3 other Fitbits other than this one. This one is much better because of the chattering aspect of it. The other ones I have to charger u stick into the back of them; well the piece holding the charger in always broke on me. This blaze charges differently and is way better. All u do is pop the screen out of the watch band and stick it in the lil charging box that it comes with. This one should last me much longer and has tons of options for bands to get for it.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|2|June 1, 2016|Love this Watch / Tracker!|I had a Fitbit Surge prior to this, but unfortunately the design of the wristband was poor and it broke. Because I did like the Fitbit tech / ecosystem I decided to get this as a replacement. That said, before receiving this I thought I was really going to miss the GPS, but as it turns out I am not missing it at all!  It works in concert with my phone app to provide the same GPS data I was getting directly from my watch before.  Since I am always using my phone to play music on runs and workouts I am not missing anything. The screen is much much better than what was on the Surge, and the design of the replaceable band is great. Now I don't have to worry about getting a whole new device if the band broke. If I had to say anything negative about it, I'd say I would like more options for the home screen. There really wasn't any one of them I "loved", so I settled and since have gotten used to it. It would be fantastic if they added an option to customize it as well.. Now, if Fitbit could only design something I could swim with...
B019VM3F2M|5.0|269|June 29, 2016|Charger|There are a lot of good reviews on this fit bit.  I am upgrading from a flex and my blaze arrives tomorrow.  I have seen complaints of people concerned and annoyed about having to pop it out of the band to charge it.  There is a charger that clips around the device while in the band.  It runs between 7.00 and 13.00 on amazon.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|3|March 9, 2016|Begin your weightloss|Love the Fitbit Blaze, the only thing I would change is the watchband, it makes me sweaty. One huge benefit is the stopwatch; since I am a nurse this comes in very handy. There are so many features...one of which is weight loss if you use this correctly!!!
B019VM3F2M|5.0|2|August 23, 2016|Love my Fitbit!|Love my Fitbit blaze!! Great addition to my fitness journey!! Keeps tracks of steps, calories burned, sleep, heart rate, other exercise activities, & can also show texts, & phone calls. Had the Fitbit zip & the Fitbit charge HR. All of Fitbits products are awesome! They stand behind their work too!!
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|June 30, 2017|I love it. This watch combined with the app helps ...|I love it. This watch combined with the app helps me make more health conscious decisions, along with keeping track of my progress. I regret it taking me this long to get it. It has a decent battery life, allows you to change your music or adjust the volume, and you can link text or messenger notifications to it.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|June 1, 2017|So Happy I Chose the Blaze!|I was on the fence for months about either getting a FitBit Blaze or an Apple Watch. After many reviews, I chose the FitBit Blaze because of all the fitness and health options it offers that the Apple Watch didn't. I also didn't need all the features that the Apple Watch provided. I love that you can change the face of the Blaze's screen, change the bands, and track your exercises and sleep pattern with the FitBit. It also reminds me to get up and move if I haven't taken 250 steps within the hour. I also have it set so if anyone calls or texts me, it'll let me know who's calling and will show me the text as well. The battery life is awesome as well. I have yet to have it die on me - I've worn it for 48 hours and the battery has never gone below "medium." With the app, it also syncs easily with My Fitness Pal. I definitely recommend the Blaze to anyone who is really into fitness and doesn't need all of the other notifications and functions that the Apple Watch provides.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|2|March 31, 2016|An Upgrade That Solves My Issue|I love Fitbit. I started with a Charge HR and it is a great starter activity tracker. There was one big problem I had with the Charge HR. The distance I walked didn't show up on the display when I turned up my wrist. It didn't matter how I set up the display I still had to press the button to see the distance. On the Blaze the distance and time show up on the Exercise screen that displays when you flip up your wrist. The Blaze also seems to be more accurate on reporting distance walked even indoors. The band is very comfortable and the entire device is lightweight. I was a little worried that it would be too large for my wrist but it fits perfectly and is actually more comfortable than the Charge HR. The Blaze lays flatter so it doesn't get caught up on cuffs of my shirt making it much more clothing friendly.Overall I am very satisfied with the Blaze.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|May 17, 2017|It's definitely a motivator|My wife bought herself the standard fit bit blaze and liked it so much she figured I had to have one. We are both working out every day now because of this gadget. It promotes competition and makes you want to get moving. This was an easy five stars. I work various shift times and sleep is always a problem. The bit tells me just how well I slept and if I need more. The text and phone call vibration feature is nice for those of us that keep our phone on silent and the food tracking is helpful as well. I wish my Pyle scale linked to the app as well but I'm still very happy with this device.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|February 25, 2017|Really useful during a busy workday|I supervise a team of 12, on a production line, interfacing with two upstream and one downstream departments.  I'm on my feet a lot.  Seeing the title and room location of meetings and the content of my text, without pulling out my phone and/or interrupting the conversation I having, has been immediately valuable.  I've long been a fan of the sleep tracking and heartrate monitoring offered by fitbit.  For me, these have worked as perfectly on this device as on the Charge HR I've been wearing for about two years. One more great thing.  I mentioned my Charge HR.  The app plays nice with both devices at once, allowing me to wear the charge during activities that would rather not be wearing the nicer Blaze, like climbing or really physical work, without losing any data.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|May 18, 2017|LOVE! Best fitbit out there!|Love this! I went from a surge to the blaze. The blaze is super lightweight compared to the surge. I love all the accessories you can purchase and the colored display. It also has a lot of clock options and you can set alarms from the fitbit rather than having to do it from the fitbit app.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|March 18, 2017|i think the fitbit blaze is great! love it so much more than my apple ...|i think the fitbit blaze is great! love it so much more than my apple watch, as i didn't use any of the apps for it. hopefully they start integrating some kind of apps though, like My Fitness Pal or something for reminders to log food! FitBit UI has always been my favorite UI out of all of the other fitness trackers. Love that it can be used across devices (android/iOS) instead of "galaxy gear" or an "apple watch" which are only compatible with their own OS.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|March 4, 2016|Very satisfied so far with its performance|I went on a whim to purchase this for myself so far I'm very pleased with the whole product I'm able to work in it without it getting in the way.  It did cause a rash on my arm after prolonged wear so now I switch it back and forth day to day till my wrist is used to it. (Same thing used to happen with watches) over all very happy it has definitely helped me try to be more active and the app helps me track my eating sleeping water intake habits as well. Very happy and you will be to or my name isnt Bobdole
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|April 18, 2017|And Smart It Is!!!|This fitness watch does so many awesome things. I probably could have bought one of the cheaper ones, but because I have a large wrist, I needed a wide band.  I wish I wasn't so lazy and would use this monitoring system to its full capabilities and get fit.  Fit Star is suburb! The warm up exercises are great.  So much better than an apple watch to me.  Being able to work out with other people around the world, and in your own back yard is a great way to meet work out buddies for motivation to stay fit.  These are real people you can email, call, and make plans to meet up.  This is exactly what I needed.  Thanks Fitbit!
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|June 19, 2017|EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!|I really LOVE this Fitbit Blaze!  All the features are excellent, and the set-up could not have been any easier.  Once you download the app to your phone and answer a couple easy questions, the app syncs to the blaze pretty much in real-time.  Lots of bells and whistles too.  I can even see my text messages on the Blaze, and it has great reminders to get you up and moving.  Just an excellent product!  I've been using it a couple months now, and I just love it!
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|May 1, 2017|Love!|I love this tracker. It's helped me lose 15 lbs by keeping track of how many calories I burn per day and eating 500 less than that. I used to have the charge HR, I love this one so much more, I love the music control, the workout tracking function, the sleep tracking function, and the ability to track my runs, as well as instant heart rate monitor. Lots of great features.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|0|December 30, 2016|Very pleased|Hands down one of the best fitness watches, I wanted something comparable to my wife's apple watch but as I haven't drunk the kool-aid and don't have an apple phone I went with this and to my surprise, it does things her watch can't, like control Spotify. It's easy to pop in and out of the band's sports one for working out and fashion one for the office. It looks like a regular watch but does so much more. The accessories won't break the bank so if you're like me and like different watch bands then you can have numerous ones.
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|February 8, 2017|Best Watch I've owned|I own roughly 15 watches and this is my go to watch!! It's looks great for my work as a healthcare professional and is good against sweat on a long run. Steps and heart rate are great features as the seven minute workout is a great way to start working out. Plus, when you get a text or call it vibrates your watch so you don't have to pull your phone right out. Great for casual & sport uses! A great smart watch
B019VM3F2M|5.0|1|December 26, 2016|Great for fitness mindfulness and awareness|This little watch has helped me to lose some weight and has made me much more mindful to get up and get exercise.  I have also used their calorie tracking app to keep track of how much I've consumed vs. burned.  I'm not Mr. Triathlon and don't even go to the gym, but this watch definitely has helped me to pay more attention to my health and keeping moving with walks and exercise during the day.  It is great for people like me that work from home and may not always be mindful to get up and simply move around more.  Thanks folks!
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|January 20, 2017|One Star|Bought this product and it came broken in the package
B0106IS5XY|1.0|3|December 16, 2016|Pebble sold us down the river.|I had hopes for this watch, now in a few months time, like they say in their blog, a lot of the functionalities will be gone which is what i purchased it for. In the end its gonna end like a cheap $2 LCD watch. We made them millionaires and this is the thanks we get in return.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|2|January 23, 2017|I'm very disappointed.|Now that Pebble has been bought out by FitBit, my watch barely works.  It does not allow for watchfaces to be changed (including the ones I paid for).  This was one of the selling points of this watch for me and now I can't do it. I have tried doing a factory reset and it still does not work.  I'm very disappointed.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|June 2, 2017|Pebble is not operational.|Pebble stopped operations as of Dec last year. So forget any support if it crashes and it does. I have had to reinstall the app on my iphone three times since it crashes.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|4|September 15, 2015|Won't pair, menu button does not work, and customer support lacking.|I love the looks of the watch and the features. Unfortunately, as soon as the Pebble links to my Nexus 5 phone it immediately then drops the connection (phone sees it as paired but unconnected device). The directions recommend go into the phone menu and forget the Pebble and then go into the Pebble menu and forget all paired devices and try again. This is when I find that the right middle button is not pulling up the menu as is indicated in the troubleshooting menu, and this is when I find out that the only customer support is by email (no phone, chat, or text). I sent the support request email to customer support and got the response "We are currently experiencing a higher-than-average amount of emails but we will respond to you as quickly as possible". Four days later and still no response--customer support is really lacking. I like the looks and features enough to wait another week for support and I hope they can resolve the issue. As it is I give it a 1 because it is torture to see and pay for a beautiful watch and not be able to use it.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|6|December 12, 2016|Left in the lurch.|Company just went out of business and sod its assets to Fitbit. No further support for the product.  Very disappointing.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|9|September 20, 2015|Original pebble is great, the Time is horrible|I have the original Pebble, which works great and I have been a huge advocate for it. However, the Pebble Time is a complete failure in my opinion. It is extremely difficult to get it to pair, it constantly has errors, the user interface is horrendous, the app fails constantly (iPhone version), and the watch face is really hard to see without the backlight on. Plus the battery life is not as good as the original, lasting about 1 day instead of 3 or 4. So it basically took all the positives of the original pebble and turned them into negatives.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|March 29, 2017|Junk|Worked for 6 months and then died. Pebble support takes forever to get back to you or ignores you completely. Don't waste your money.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|August 19, 2017|Looked like a great buy...|...but my unit came in dead and would not charge.

B0106IS5XY|1.0|3|May 13, 2017|Waste of money|I purchased this for my husband about a month ago. It worked properly for maybe 2 weeks, but then it started constantly losing Bluetooth connection. We did multiple factory resets (as suggested online - his phone has the proper version of Android), but now it won't even connect at all. The seller said they won't help since it's a tech support issue.  And Pebble doesn't really support this model anymore since it's an older one. Don't waste your money on this. Spend a little more and get a supported version.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|April 27, 2016|One Star|sent back. not bright enough to see!
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|June 5, 2016|I'm very disappointed.|I tried charging it many ways and it never turned on.  I have to return it for a full refund, I'm very disappointed.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|3|June 26, 2017|Pebble out of business|I had high hopes for this watch. I received it, put it on charge and went to the website for the app. The website says the company is out of business, they have no idea how much longer the watches will work, they will be no more updates and there is no more warranty. I put it back in the box and returned it to Amazon. It may be a great watch but if they  won't stand behind it then I'm not interested.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|1|March 20, 2017|Finding some problem within few months as watch is not ...|Finding some problem within few months as watch is not getting on. Charger connecting shows 100% charged right-away on connecting to usb.

B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|January 22, 2017|Watch defect|Delivery was swift however,  product is less than expectation. Can you tell me where I can get the watch fixed or replaced as the watch steamed up inside when we swim with it in a pool
B0106IS5XY|1.0|3|January 20, 2017|Fantastic watch - great app|I bought this watch for my son for Christmas. He loves it. LOVES it. Fantastic watch - great app, user interface etc.  However, I had NO idea that Pebble had been sold to FitBit and would no longer receive any support and long term functionality is unlikely.  Boooo.  Amazon probably needs to pull this product from it's store as the warranty and future support are all now null and void.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|2|March 25, 2017|Shipper did a wonderful job. Loved the watch|Shipper did a wonderful job. Loved the watch, and then I found out FitBit bought Peeble and sometime in 2017 they will not be providing any support for your Peeble watch. Therefore making it useless.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|3|June 5, 2016|Thought it was the answers to my problem.|I woro in a secure office where phones, ipods, etc. are prohibited. The watch looks great however I was unable to obtain the necessary application from Pebble.com to get it to work. Very disappointed.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|2|July 16, 2016|Watch had a scratch when i received it.|My watch came with a scratch on it. The packaging looked perfect but when I opened the package, I found that there was a scratch on the watch.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|December 17, 2015|I have had the watch for almost 4 months and ...|I have had the watch for almost 4 months and battery does not last the day even when fully charged. The bluetooth connection does not connect every time and I have to shut down watch or phone to get it to connect. My husband has an older version of pebble and gets days of charge. Had I known the problems I have had with this watch I would not have purchased it, especially with the money that I paid.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|1|December 30, 2016|Unreliable glad pebble is gone|I owned this watch of less than a month before I started having issues (moisture under the screen, not pairing with my phone, 8hr battery life) I contacted pebble before they went out of business it took them over a month to respond to my email and they then refused to fix my pebble
B0106IS5XY|1.0|4|October 28, 2016|One star, bad product , do not buy it, I would like to return it but it is over 3 month|Bad product, after 3 month of using this watch the battery doesn't charge or charging just for 1 day of use even it says Fully Charged do not by this watch, now I have to trash it

B0106IS5XY|1.0|4|December 15, 2016|Faulty product|The display is totally fogged up.  I wore it while washing my hands and now I can't even read anything clearly. It is definitely not water resistant..or may be i got a faulty product!
B0106IS5XY|1.0|4|October 7, 2016|Don't but a Pebble|Worst product ever. Would no sync to my phone no matter what I tried. Attempted to contact Pebble but was not responsive. Bought a Garmin which works great right out of the box. No wonder Pebble was so cheap !!!
B0106IS5XY|1.0|2|March 20, 2017|Broke in one month and Pebble is gone, so NO SUPPORT!|This broke after one month of easy use.  One morning the screen just wouldn't display after charging.  Had to throw it away because Pebble was bought by FitBit and no longer offers any support.  Went out and bought an Apple watch the next day.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|September 20, 2017|One Star|Didn't work properly. I have to chose between monitoring my sleep and have phone calls and messages buzzing.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|7|December 8, 2016|No warranty, no service, Pebble went bankrupt.|I've had this watch for about 2 months now. I wanted a basic smart watch to receive notifications on. This watch handles that perfectly. The voice dictation always disconnects, however. The watch would also Rialto pair with my iPhone 6s occasionally. The kicker is that Pebble just announced bankruptcy yesterday (12/6/16) and now that Fitbit owns them, who knows what features will stop working. All warranties are now void, and a lot of pebble customers have been left to the wind. It's a shame because the battery life and design really made the watch worth it, even with the sometimes spotty functionality.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|3|April 18, 2017|Don't buy|Do not buy. I've had this watch for 1 month and have lost it a hand full of times already. It comes off my arm all the time. The pins don't stay in the watch.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|61|September 6, 2015|BE AWARE the Watch is NOT WATERPROOF|Everything was ok until this morning. I purchased the watch over a month ago and this morning I woke up with the screen covered by condensation. This watch is supposed to be waterproof and I have never used it on a pool or at the sea, I just shower with it daily. I have attached an image so you can see what the problem is.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|1|May 23, 2017|Disappointing purchases...|This is the second time I've ordered a Pebble smartwatch from Amazon and it doesn't work, it just keeps bootlooping despite whatever fix I try . I'm really disappointed.This is a shame and I may just have to take my business somewhere else.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|2|May 14, 2017|One Star|This watch has died after less than six months.  It will not charge & is now a paperweight.

B0106IS5XY|1.0|10|August 17, 2016|Disappointed. The watch itself seems good|Open package received. Disappointed. The watch itself seems good.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|3|August 3, 2016|Horrible battery life|This things battery life sucks. It's advertised as getting 7 days, I can get maybe 3 if I am lucky but it's more likely only 2. I put in a ticket with their support system and it took a week to get a response. All that response said was there are a lot of crashes happening that are caused by a new update and they are looking into it. I asked for an ETA and didn't get a response. I then asked if there was a way to roll the software back to a version that worked and again no response. I sent another email a few days later and finally got a response but all they said was sorry for the delay and that the issue was escalated. Still no answer on a time frame.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|September 24, 2016|One Star|I can't get it to sync with app.

B0106IS5XY|1.0|1|January 7, 2017|A two time use device.|This watch is terrible. I've had it for one day and it's been working for a few hours. After having some weird glithces where apps that I got for it weren't showing up, I decided to factory reset it. Now, when I put it next to my phone, it says that the blue tooth is out of range. Pebble's "support" is a template sent straight into a garbage bin. As for charging, I plugged it in and it didn't charge. I had $69, and I'm gonna get them back because that was a huge waste of cash, time, and energy. I expected more out of pebble, but I suppose anything I've thought will be awesome sucked.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|November 8, 2016|Bought a rubbish|Cannot connect to phone, error when reset, no way to fix, bought a rubbish.
B0106IS5XY|1.0|9|March 4, 2016|water issue|This watch after 4 months got water under the screen. ( I only took showers with it never went swimming with it on). I put it in rice, kept it off my wrist for a few weeks trying to get the droplets off from  my inside screen.  Nothing worked, under the screen the condensation was getting worse, where finally the watch would no longer charge and the screen was black.  I would not recommend this watch if there is any possibility it will be worn around water.

B0106IS5XY|1.0|0|September 15, 2016|Not for counting steps|I enjoy my grand child's picture on the face of the watch. If you are buying the pebble to monitor your steps it is NOT accurate. Example I did 1-1/2 miles on the treadmill and it showed 360 steps. My fit was more accurate.

B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|December 5, 2016|Good for only a short time|I held back from giving my review for the watch, but I've had this watch for two months now and I've been having problems lately. At first it was working great, doing all of the functions I needed it to do (i.e. fitness tracking, notifications for calls/texts, tracking sleep), was always connected to Bluetooth like promised. After a while the battery started to slack, as it seems to be dying a day after charging. Soon after, the watch would stop connecting to my iPhone and the app -- which lost some data in the moments that it stopped working.  Now I have a hard time with the basic functions of it. It keeps turning off by itself at random times and just doesn't hold up to what it used to be anymore. After having it for such a short period of time compared to other reviews, I think this watch should have been less than $50 than the $90 I had paid for it (at the time of purchase). Overall I did like it because it helped me in my daily life as a busy, on-the-go theater undergrad. Unfortunately though, I will not be buying another other ever again for its short lifespan.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|May 31, 2017|Two Stars|No like me
B0106IS5XY|2.0|2|April 4, 2017|Would not recommend buying one|Returned before I received it, due to Pebble going out of business.  Would not recommend buying one, as there will be no future support starting in December of 2016.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|July 28, 2017|Not durable enough for me but a great company & watch!|This works great but the interface looks like it is from the 90's. Also it scratches VERY easily when knocked. I was happy with the way it functioned but it did appear to stop synching with my phone only after a couple of weeks. We returned it & ordered a new model of The Pebble, Pebble steal which is much more durable & so worth the extra $$ :) Don't waste your dollah on an Apple Watch!
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|August 31, 2016|Two Stars|Features aren't very good
B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|August 23, 2017|Water damage|I was in the pool and later when I check my watch I saw moisture, so I put the Watch in rice for 2 days and nothing. Its been 1 week and there still moisture. NOT 30meters as advertised.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|November 20, 2016|Not good value when it stops charging after 5 months|I am giving this two stars as my son loves the watch. It is only getting two stars because we bought in June and it stopped charging at the end of October. Replaced charger but that did nothing. For the price of the watch, that is unacceptable. If it cost $30 then sure, fun for 5 months, but for the $108 he paid for it, not cool. Now I see it is going for $80 some odd dollars which bothers me even more. I have contacted the sellers to hear what they have to say and will update review accordingly. The watch did everything my son wanted - played music, had a cool way to change interface screen, recorded everything he wanted recorded in way of fitness, could check mail and text etc. Other than it not charging after 5 months rendering it useless, he liked it.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|June 29, 2016|Requires Pebble app to even use it as a watch!|I have not been able to use this watch yet because it requires some sort of Pebble app with a Pebble account to even turn the damn thing on. No thanks, Pebble. Form factor is nice, though.

B0106IS5XY|2.0|2|September 2, 2015|Great!....until I went swimming.|Had it for about 2 weeks. Absolutely loved it! Watch looked great, especially the color screen. I really liked it. However, after I went swimming, moisture got under the screen. Since I got it third party, I didn't have a warranty. Made my watch impossible to read, also zapped the battery so it only lasted maybe two hours. Too expensive for me personally to get a new one. Basically, wonderful watch, but I would really recommend AGAINST testing that water resistance.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|2|August 2, 2015|Watchface scratches.|The face of the watch scratched. I went swimming with it because a waterproof watch should be a sport watch. I can no longer comfortably read the watch face because of the scratches that appeared when I came out of the river
B0106IS5XY|2.0|3|September 23, 2015|Two Stars|for the money your better off the first pebble.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|February 20, 2016|Quite nice but sleep tracking useless and overall activity tracking is inaccuarate.|Very nice feature and is exactly what I was looking for, however the health part, in particular sleep tracking is useless. It tells me that I only sleep 1-3 hours a night while I average 7. I tested with other iOS apps. I hope this gets fixed. [Update: suprisingly inaccurate. Today it told me: "you walked about 24 minutes and burned 93 cal. didn't that feel good?". I was at home on my computer!!! What a waste. However, it's a nice watch ;)]
B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|March 12, 2016|A Very Disappointing Display|It's a neat watch, cool features, looks decent. But I couldn't get over the low brightness of the display. I know it's e-paper but Amazon's own kindle is far brighter. I would gladly sacrifice 2 days of battery life (to cut it down from 7 to 5 days) for a brighter display. The watch already looks like a toy, and the dim display makes it even look worse. Don't trust the stock picture on this Amazon post as the watch is no where near as bright as the picture indicates, even when "shaken" to activate. It's okay outside in the sunlight, still not great, but absolutely dim and unacceptable indoors,
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|June 7, 2017|Not very happy about it at all and feel like I wasted ...|It's an ok smartwatch. It crashes all the time and resets by itself. The battery only last a day and a half. Not very happy about it at all and feel like I wasted my money. I like the apps and how you can change the watch face. The tracking when your walking is nice and the sleep tracking feature is nice also. But, far less cheaper watches can do that also. I wouldn't buy it again.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|January 28, 2017|Pebble|The screen has major scratches and smears that hinder clearly viewing the watch screen. Watch works though, just misleading advertisement about condition by seller.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|March 27, 2017|Look Elsewhere|Not worth it. The battery lasts 3 days and the text messages notification does not go away after checking them on the phone. This mainly good to raise the volume when listening to music, changing the song playing, and getting a notification of a phone call. The voice text messaging system sucks too. Just getting something more better than this piece of junk.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|September 14, 2016|Looses blue tooth connection on my phone.  Otherwise good watch.|I like the concept of the watch, generally how it works, and always on and battery life.  My problem was it wouldn't stay connected to my phone with Bluetooth.  It kept loosing connection.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|July 2, 2016|Great functionality but poor materials.|Great functionality but poor materials. I've had this watch for about 6 months and it is in horrible shape. You shouldn't need a screen protector for a watch? I had the older pebble and it was built well. This one not so much.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|August 13, 2017|Very entry level smartwatch|Very entry level smartwatch.  My 13 year old son wasn't even interested. Worth spending a bit more for something with more features and better looking interface.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|August 4, 2016|Poor battery life|Poor battery life.  Lasted 2 days.  I contacted pebble and they basically had me run with nothing else operating which lasted another day or two.  Basically I purchased for notifications from outlook and for long battery life with the expectation I would only need to charge On weekends.  This failed. The analog watch face I liked with no second hand reduced battery life by a day. with the battery life I had and the fact I stopped using as a result, I would have been better served by an Apple Watch. Maybe others will have better luck.  Pebble never identified the product as flawed when I reported issues and I never received support that fixed the issue.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|2|June 15, 2017|Disappointed.|I gave this two stars because of a very important necessity missing. I was excited for my Pebble time to come and it did. The only problem is that there was NO CHARGER! And the item is currently dead because of it not having any charge. If you are going to sell a watch without a charger, GIVE a warning next time. Also, how about charging it fully so I can actually use it. Disappointed.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|May 15, 2017|Not the best|I'm now thinking of all the ways to use these awesome products Things received immediately after the check, find and picture description is consistent, super love, sell the home to deliver goods fast, and the service is in place, give the boss some praise, the next will be to buy... My worst buy ever on Amazon Complete utter feces. can't go wrong with that!  I will be recommending it to my friends
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|February 10, 2017|Two Stars|Very moody watch! Works about 30% of the time.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|26|August 3, 2015|Very Limited Customer Support.|Buyers should be aware that Pebble customer and tech support is very thin.  No phone support, only the possibility of email advice after a significant time lag.  While I have heard that others like their Pebble Times, in my case, the new watch is not connecting to my phone's Bluetooth..While I realize that Pebble is a startup with limited resources (and am sympathetic),  the lack of tech assistance is a real problem for me.

B0106IS5XY|2.0|3|June 30, 2016|Not water resistant|Worked well, though it is a little hard to see in sunlight. The reason I got this for my son, however, was because it was advertised as being water resident up to 30 m.  It says you can swim with it,  but when he went swimming water got into it and it got foggy inside.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|3|August 7, 2017|Watch Is Not Waterproof, And Company Sold, What's That Tell You!|Bought this watch in January 2017.  It's been a great watch until I  noticed condensation inside the glass a couple days ago. Also, found out Pebble sold out to Fitbit. All warranty returns void?  Don't waste your money.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|January 11, 2017|Allergic reaction|Allergic to the backside of the watch itself. Something about the metal I assume. Large gives where it contacts the top of my wrist.

The user interface and graphics didn't sit well with me. Not my kind of watch. I like things streamlined like Samsung and this was just a different set up and older school.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|1|June 29, 2016|Terrible Display!|Someone needs to tell the young whipper snapper Pebble nerds that just because they can read things doesn't mean everybody can.  I should not need to carry my reading glasses around with me all the time simply because I want to be able to read the display.  I don't need glasses to see my phone, so I shouldn't need them to see my smartwatch either. The concept is great.  I love the convenience of not having to pull out my phone when I'm in the classroom, at church, or at a meeting.  But if I see I have a notification, yet still need to take out my phone in order to be able to read it, that kind of defeats the purpose. In my younger days, I would have probably given this watch 5 stars.  For only 99 bucks, It does everything that a smartwatch should do, and does it flawlessly.  But for someone who is over 40, I guess we have to pay more for a display that we can actually see.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|0|July 24, 2017|Discontinued product - can't get it to work|I bought this knowing it was discontinued but I've had it for more than a month and haven't been able to get it to work, except to count steps. There are virtually NO instructions on how to use. Mind-boggling that a product like this comes with a tiny instruction page. I may have gotten a damaged model. Buyer beware.

My eyes aren't that bad but I found it very difficult to read notifications on this device. I set to the largest font and brightest setting yet notifications are still too difficult to read. It is easier to get my phone out. Everything else is fine. Check this out in person before purchasing.
B0106IS5XY|2.0|2|August 25, 2015|Not worth the wait|Not worth the wait - Soft Plastic Soft Band/Strap, attracts Dust and never looks Clean. Apps - just ordinary. Battery Life -maybe about 7 day's at a pinch. Overall - Disappointing

Gives the same display after charging for several hours. Worked great when it worked. James Knox

B0106IS5XY|3.0|1|July 2, 2016|Be very carefull around water!|Love the watch and how it last many days before needing to be recharged but it is advertised water-resistant up to 30meters which isn't the whole truth. Seems if the water your in isn't far from the actual temperature of the watch your fine but if you are in a hot tub or even a hot bath the pressure changes and it takes on water. Very sad.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|July 8, 2016|No customer service phone number.|Big problem is that Pebble has no customer service to call, everything is done via email and that could take days to get a problem resolved. I owned mine for 4 months and now it will not stay connected to my phone and a frozen up.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|September 12, 2016|Works for Me|Nice watch, but very bad screen resolution. Faces look nothing like the pictures.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|August 24, 2017|Good for the price|The interface is not as helpful as the original Pebble Classic, vibration is weaker, too hard to check time and date due to having to clear notifications first compared to Classic.  The display does not mess up routinely like the Classic did which is a plus.  Will continue to play with notifications to drop down to a bare minimum of important ones so that the watch is more useful as a watch too.  Better haptic engine needed for a notification watch.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|September 17, 2016|I like the long battery life and watch face being on ...|I like the long battery life and watch face being on all the time. But the software on the Iphone for searching watch apps is a piece junk. When I search for new apps, many times the Iphone shows only the first page of apps list as the NEXT page button is hidden. Therefore, there is no way to browse more apps. I am using Iphone 6 Plus.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|March 2, 2017|Pebble was the greatest, but now Fitbit owns them...|This is the best smart watch on the market, bar none. Better battery life than anything else (except the pebble time steel), simple interface and I get all my notifications there so my phone can spend more time in my pocket. I'm lowering my review from 5 stars to 3 because fitbit already made me give them an email address as part of the newest update, and randomly removed some apps from my watch. It's only a matter of time before they kill everything pebble related - why compete when you can crush instead?
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|February 5, 2017|if i had a new opportunity to buy a smartwatch i would buy a Huawei watch or moto 360. The pebble time has a bad Bluetooth conec|Very simple and bad conection
B0106IS5XY|3.0|6|November 21, 2016|Functionality great but bezel scratches easily|As a former owner of the original Pebble (which resulted in defective watches three times but I was still loyal since they were all replaced under warranty), I really like the functionality of the Pebble Time and the always on screen.  I can live without all of the Android apps as this does everything I need in terms of notifications and the like with somewhat better battery life (usually 3 or 4 days max though - not the advertised length).  Where it falls really short is the material used for the bezel and the watch band.  I did see others comment on how easy the bezel scratches but chose to take that risk. Believe me, it does easily scratch -- I am by no means rough with any electronic equipment I own and out of the blue noticed two scratches on the bezel. Really disappointed as now there are mars on it that can't be removed.  Second issue is the original band included.  While it was comfortable, after a period of time I started developing a rash where the band meets the skin.  So had to purchase a leather band for it which works fine.  So, without the bad bezel and band, this would have been 4 stars and if battery life held true to what is advertised it would be 5 stars.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|September 24, 2016|just didn't like the lack of a touch screen|wasn't for me. i used the original moto 360 with the touch screen. going from that to this just didnt do it for me. no actual problem with use. just didn't like the lack of a touch screen.

B0106IS5XY|3.0|1|August 9, 2015|Needs improvement|A great watch overall. That being said, I prefer the original. The overall software seems much better but the screen is so much harder to read than the original. You have to use the back light or have super bright sunlight in order to see this. The original was easily viwed regardless as long as it was not pitch black
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|June 2, 2016|Small text for me.|3 stars because it's a great product but it just didn't work for me. Not the watch fault but my vision is not so great up close so the text on it was super small. I'm sure if you have good eyes you'll love this watch. I ended up buying a Zenwatch 2 and love it. Big, bold text and just a better overall smartwatch for me.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|September 21, 2016|it recommends downloading android wear app for a better experience, but the watch is incompatible with the ...|The watch serves its purpose, but the interface is primative. Also, it recommends downloading android wear app for a better experience, but the watch is incompatible with the app. Battery lasts 2 1/2 days, so that's pretty good. Overall...it's just an ok watch.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|October 17, 2016|Great... at first|Great for the first 6 months. The battery life never lived up to what I had thought it would be. I never got more than 3 days out of a charge, even despite doing all the suggested tricks. I purchased mine less than a year ago, and over the last month the battery is closer to two days. Also, it seems to freeze once a week where I have to do a full reboot and resynch to my phone. Bluetooth Connectivity is getting spottier also. Should emphasize however that it was the best watch I have ever owned (for the first 1/2 year)
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|October 25, 2016|Looks great-problems with holding battery charge.|I love the display/faceplate choices. It's easy to read and see. What I don't like is the lack of availability of support for questions and problems, the inavalability of a manual (on-line or in the box) and how often it needs to be charged. My original pebble held its charge for at least 4-5 days. The new one is telling me it needs to be charged almost every day, which I find frustrating and unacceptable.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|March 28, 2016|Three Stars|It's a really cool watch. However it wasn't for me.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|January 16, 2016|below average quality for 200.00 watch|I really liked this watch when I saw it on a friend.  I have worn the watch 4 months and the buttons have been difficult to operate and eventually the watch would freeze up.  Also, even with the backlight the screen was too dark and lacked sharp color.  I have contacted Pebble customer service for a replacement watch.  If I don't get a replacement and it is better ,  I doubt I will order another of these.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|September 25, 2016|Meh...|I really wanted to love this watch.  The band was comfortable and the overall weight was near perfect.  I had two major issues:  The watch would not stay connected to my iPhone 6 plus.  I would have to go into the phone and open the app over and over to keep it connected.  The other major issue is the display size.  Its too small to see most watch faces.  I would buy another one if the display size was increased and the connection issues resolved.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|December 20, 2016|These 2 watches came in worse wear than I expected|These 2 watches came in worse wear than I expected, but they work. New bands, screen protectors and skins made them presentable enough as gifts to preteens. However, with the demise of Pebble I wish I had made a different purchase.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|1|August 11, 2016|Reaction to the band|I bought this Smartwatch for my boyfriend and he loves all of the functions. The only thing he wishes it has is a music application. Why we are rating this as three stars is because the band that is provided has caused a rash, blisters and looks like a burn. He is now looking for a different band because he truly loves the watch.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|April 16, 2016|I really wanted to love the pebble but in the end it is only ...|I really wanted to love the pebble but in the end it is only ok. The hardware is good and it looks much better in person than in photos online. The software is the issue since 3rd party developers are not really supporting the platform and it has second best phone integration. I was hoping pebble health would be able to replace my fitbit but it isn't as good and I get some very odd sleep data from it. If you are interested in a smartwatch this might be a decent place to start but you might be happier with something that has more functionality.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|November 28, 2016|Love the functionality, Battery life is horrible|I have a Blackberry and was looking forward to using this watch as it is the only compatible watch I could use. Even with the limited function you et with Blackberry I enjoyed using the watch. I did not however enjoy the horrible battery life. The watch boasts up to 5 days, and after a full charge I'm lucky to get 24 hours. I read that refurbished models had battery life problems, that's why I put the extra money into a new model.  I am returning it for a full refund, maybe I will try another model, maybe not.

B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|February 1, 2016|Simple|I'm downgrading my original review to only 3 stars.

Watch is to expensive for band to fail so soon.

Missing plastic wrap on power cable.  Screen bezel creaks badly with slightest pressure. Debating on whether to return it due to bad creaking noise. Soft touch band feels nice.Buttons are solid. 1.25 inch screen acceptable though would have been better with 1.5 inch screen..
B0106IS5XY|3.0|1|November 22, 2016|as I am a petite female thewatch if far from attractive on my wrist|I wrote the wrong review on the covers for this product.  Item works well & as described. But, as I am a petite female the watch if far from attractive on my wrist.  This watch was by far the most feminine of smart watches that would work with my cell version 4.0. I do not need a new phone & therefore could not buy the Pebble Round.  The watch works well with the exception that I can not find a vibration that I can feel in a loud environment. I wanted a smart watch so I could hear my husband when he texted to ask where I was as he is in the same Large Place & could not find me. I do feel the vibration on occasion & hope that I will adjust & be able to feel it.  Still learning & will update review if it works better. But, I would still leave out the Stars for the Unfeminine appearance.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|0|April 5, 2017|No warranty or support|These watches are phenomenal. However, Pebble was recently purchased by FitBit and all Pebble watches no longer have warranties or support. Be aware of this. My watch corrupted and is no longer usable and there's no support to help fix this issue.
B0106IS5XY|3.0|1|February 9, 2017|So so....|No problem with the transaction: timely delivery, good price, but the watch itself leaves a bit to be desired.  I get no more than 24 hours use before the watch stops working and needs to be charged.  Also, the typeface is tiny, and the watch itself feels a little too small for practical use.

Although you can initiat calls from the Pebble Time, you cannot actually talk with it since it does not have a speaker (just a microphone). That was disappointing to find out, but not a deal breaker. The other issue as others have noted is the poor battery life. I have yet to get much more that 2 full days out of a single charge. Otherwise, I love how the watch fits.

It was one of the few watches that had even the possibility of being Blackberry compatible.  The compatibility  is glitchy even after calling support, watching videos etc.  But he uses it for a pedometer and as a regular old watch and when it decides not to be glitchy he can get his email and monitor his phone calls.  All in all the product is not bad.  We imagine that it would be spot on for an android phone.  The styling is very nice and so we are hoping for some app upgrade that will get rid of the glitches.  All in all for the price we are good with the purchase.

If you're going to buy this watch, I recommend you to order a screen protector and a skin wrap to protect it as soon as posible.

My only problem is that the buttons feel kinda bad on the plastic model. The metal version is definitely better. And since all interactions are done through the buttons, it would be nice to have them feel a little more clicky and less mushy.

B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|January 29, 2016|Great, but...|I really enjoy this watch so far. Only have had it for about 2 weeks and it's really nice and easy to use. My only complaint is that I've already scratched the watchface to hell. I read that the gorilla glass was harder to scratch but clearly this is not true. Also I've scratched the outside metal area as well. All cosmetic, but I would absolutely recommend buying a watchface scratch proof cover.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|March 16, 2017|Still a great watch|Got the PT after heard aboyt Fitbit acquiring Pebble. Decided to get it becuase I knew it's going to be usful for me anyway. The watch is great. Contrast is lower on this comparing to the OG (Which I have) but still good enough. The only problem I have is the fact every 3-4 weeks I get the SOS screen which says I need to restore the watch software. Can't tell what's the reason but for now I can leave with it. Pebble is no more exists but this watch is still the best because it does what our smartwatch need to do and for 5-6 days + when you out of battery you still can see the hour for about 12 hours
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|November 9, 2015|I absolutely love this watch|I absolutely love this watch. If you want a smart phone on your wrist, then this probably isn't for you. While it is able to do a lot, it has a very simple look. But that's not what I was looking for. I was looking for something that is more like an actual watch, and this is the perfect combination of both. Pros: EXTREMELY light and comfortable, looks good, simple to set up and just as simple to use, compatible with both iPhone and android, great battery life, and I love love love that it's waterproof. That was a huge selling point for me! Cons: The only cons I have is that I am unable to respond to text messages on the watch (I have an iPhone) and I do wish the screen was just a tad bit brighter. I like that the screen is always on, but I do have to use the backlight a lot of the time, and it would be nice to avoid having to do that so much. Bottom line: if you are looking for an every day watch that can also do a lot of the same things your phone can do, then this is may very well be the watch for you. If you are looking for an exact replica of your iPhone/Android on your wrist but in a smaller version, then you might want to spend the extra couple hundred on the Apple Watch/Android Wear.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|October 4, 2016|Good watch for your money.|This watch works great for what I wanted it for. I have an iPhone 6 Plus and the pebble app. I usually charge the battery about once a week. The watch seems to track my steps and my sleep pattern very well. The companion app with IOS hasn't given me any trouble yet. Compared to other options for IOS I feel these watches would be a good purchase for basic health tracking. You can also get any standard 22 mm watch band for it. 10/11/16 Still loving this watch there were a few updates that pebble came out with but everything running correctly I even have it controlling my media center at the house.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|May 18, 2016|I am in love (of course this is only after one day of ...|I am in love (of course this is only after one day of use).  It is easy to use and synced well with my iPhone.  I had lots of questions about how it would pair, and it is capable of doing all I hoped for.  I can read and voice respond to texts, and see any and all notifications my phone receives .  My only complaint is the comfort of the straps; it has been a long time since I have worn a watch with this type of band- so perhaps I will get used to it.  I was able to order a new wrist band; if it works well, I will change to a 5 star review!
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|July 13, 2017|Just aware : STRAP causing skin irritation !|Thanx to e-paper screen battery life is good.  But display too hard to read for me,needs better back light. Watch strap is cheap PU and causing skin irritation.(Could be change 22 mm nato strap) All other functions except strap is successful.  if battery life is important and you don't want to be charging every day or two, this is your watch.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|October 6, 2015|No frills but works well. Solid product.|While I'm sure I could find things to complain about with this watch (the thickness, visibility of the screen in certain conditions, the very limited interface), I don't believe I will. It's a great watch. It's simple to operate, the color screen allows for some nice apps and watch-faces, and best of all is the incredible battery life (especially compared to any other 'smartwatch' on the market today). I regularly get 5 days before needing a recharge. Also, there's a good range of apps available for free or pay. I've been using it for shopping lists; it's nice to not have to take my phone out of my pocket constantly to check what else I need or mark something off when I put it in the basket. Also, I've got it set up as a step counter and sleep tracker thanks to a couple of low-cost apps. It might not do EVERYTHING that the more expensive watches do, but it works well and is a solid product.

It Has some error & factory reset several times. It makes me angry. Then, now has no problem work perfectly, except "timeline" So, it makes lost 1star.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|July 27, 2016|A Basic Smart Watch|Does the basics very well.  It alerts me on incoming calls and text messages.  I can send short text messages using the mic.  Long battery life, as I only need to charge it once a week.  I find text messages difficult to read when the watch is at an angle, like when I am driving.  The watch does not come with a heart rate monitor.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|July 26, 2016|Very Convenient|I often don't hear my phone ring—or forget to take it off Do Not Disturb. This makes sure I'm aware of all calls (and can ignore ones I don;t want to take without having to get my phone out. I just have to remember to take it off when I take a nap since it will vibrate even when the phone is on Do Not Disturb. I have worn a wrist watch for at least 60 years and don't want to have to pull out my phone to see the time. So this meets two needs for me. Shortcomings are no sound or vibration notification for texts. I've checked all the settings I can find. It would be nice to be able to reply to texts (on iOS), but I really don't consider not being able to do so much of a shortcoming at this point.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|December 25, 2016|Buy a shield, love the watch.|Love this watch, marked it down a star because the face scratched within days. I upgraded from the last model which never scratched. I live on a farm and work with my hands all day. I wash my milking gear and water my animals with my watch on without issue. I don't shower with it on. I have no clouding like others have reported. I charge once a week or so.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|April 30, 2017|Very nice watch.|I love my Pebble Time! It does what it says it can do and I am surprised at how much I rely on it. I even enjoy changing watch faces from time to time. It's like getting a new watch whenever I want. The only negative is this: I bought the black and every time I hit my wrist on something it scratched the 'frame'. Yesterday I took some fine sandpaper to it and now it looks like brushed steel and shouldn't scratch anymore. ☺️

B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|April 29, 2017|I was disappointed when the battter in the Moto watch failed and ...|I purchased this watch after owning a Moto 360 for 2 years.  I was disappointed when the battter in the Moto watch failed and discoverd it couldn't be replaced.  The price was right for the Pebble and it serves the purpose I want in a smartwatch.  To me it makes no sense to pay a premium price for a smartwatch when the battery can't be replaced.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|April 20, 2017|Pretty good|Have had the watch a few weeks now and over all really like it. Does what I need it to. Only issues I have is it needs to be charged at least every 4 days definitely doesn't last 5 to 7 days. And it has frozen up on me once but that was a day or two after getting it and hasn't happened since. I am a dog groomer and constantly have the watch in the water and am pretty rough on it and it's held up well so far.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|April 24, 2017|Four Stars|Apparently discontinued item  but no matter.  I use it to track steps at gym and it works.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|February 24, 2017|Great watch!|While I DO love this watch there are some obvious pitfalls. The major one of course being that the company that manufactures and supports these watches was purchased by Fitbit and was essentially shut down. Now while fitbit has said they will "maintain the user experience through 2017" who can even tell what that means. There is no real visible support for this watch if you are in fact have difficulties with the hardware or software. Having said all of that, I do really like this watch. Its a great, inexpensive alternative to the Apple Watch and has some wonderfully convenient features. I love the variety of watch faces and the ability to quickly check a text message with tracking down my phone while I'm in a meeting is priceless. The only "problem" to speak of so far is unreliable Bluetooth connection but I can usually remedy the problem by forgetting both connection and re-pairing the watch to my iPhone. Hopefully Fitbit will find room for Pebble support within its brand, if not, I'll enjoy this watch while I can.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|August 22, 2015|i love the watch but there are a few issues with ...|i love the watch but there are a few issues with the design. 1. the finish scratches really easily: any bump on a somewhat hard surface will scratch the matt finish on the watch-face. 2. the software needs work: i am constantly having to uninstall/reinstall the pebble time app for android. I did find that if you disconnect then reconnect the watch it sometimes fixes the issue but i shouldn't have to do that twice or more a week. From time to time the battery life goes form 3-4 days to 5-6 hours; the watch won't update; i can't load setting in the android app and I won't receive notifications. There is a large amount of watch-faces to chose from and a lot of apps. I'm happy about it but i wish the software was better.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|July 1, 2016|I love this watch although I have to admit that I ...|I love this watch although I have to admit that I sent the first one back because the battery wasn't holding a charge. The new is better but doesn't last the 7 days the claim. For the price you can''t beat it, it does all of the thing you want and none of the things you don't. It is the perfect balance between a Fit-bit which does almost nothing and an Apple Watch that does more than you need.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|August 21, 2017|Good Price!|love these. They are more than a watch. I just wish they were Windows 10 savey.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|August 22, 2016|So far I'm happy with it|Decent watch overall. My needs  were simple, something for notification and I don't want to pay the Apple Watch price. So far I'm happy with it, bluetooth is always connected and I get all my notifications. Although I had the watch self disconnect a couple of times, but for the price I can live with it.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|September 9, 2017|its a pretty coolwatch|i bought this a few months ago, its a pretty cool watch, but if you want to add any faces or pretty much anything, you have to buy them. too much of a hassle for me, stopped wearing it a long time ago, dont even know where it is at the moment.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|November 19, 2015|Really like thiswatch|Really like this watch.  I have this watch paired with an iPhone 6.  I had a Pebble Time Steel that a friend let me borrow for a few months that was also awesome.  I actually bought the original plastic Pebble here on Amazon, but it didn't last for much more than two week before it experienced the screen tearing issue.  This Pebble Time has been awesome so far and I love the timeline interface.  The vibration alerts are very strong and the bluetooth range seems to be much further than the Pebble Time Steel.  The only downside is that the screen is a little dimmer than I thought it would be, but I've compensated for that by using a high contrast watchface.  This is a great watch that does everything I want without the extra cost (and unneeded feature) of the Apple watch.  I love that the Pebble Time is "always on".  :)
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|July 14, 2016|First one had battery issues, but manufacturer replaced it and next one works great.|Battery life isn't even close to what is advertised...  and I am not what you would call a "heavy user" ;).  Probably average 5-10 text notifications and 2-3 calendar reminders per day. I dont use any fancy watch faces or other battery sucking applications.  Currently working with manufacturer and they may replace it, in which case I'll rerate if the replacement has better performance, but for now very disappointed. Update. The replacement is working well. Still don't get quite a week out of it despite being a light user, but it works well with my android version 4.4 phone.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|January 31, 2017|Love my watch|Love my watch. Battery life is great. They only thing is that I can not start a new text, they have canned message that you can use to reply or you can use your voice. Everytime I try to talk into it it never u derstands what I'm saying. I am not able to carry my cell phone on me while working so this is nice to have. It alerts me on calls and messages.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|December 22, 2016|Love it but now it is gone -- after only 3 months|I absolutely loved this watch.  It was my 2nd Pebble. But it just died last night after only having it 3 months and of course there is no recourse now that Pebble has been bought out by FitBit.  If you purchase this watch, do NOT let the battery EVER run out.  That seems to be what causes many of the issues that cause the watch to no longer work.  I am so sad because I really, really liked this watch.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|August 26, 2016|First smart watch|This is my first smart watch that my mom bought for me as a celebratory gift. This watch has a variety of free watch faces available for download on its "app store" which allows you to customize it. There's a lot of apps available, but a lot of them seem redundant, such as having a timer, stopwatch, "flashlight", or pedometer. There doesn't seem to be anything "new". I actually haven't tried any of the fitness apps, so I have little else to add. It's okay when it comes to maneuvering through the watch's interface. IIt was confusing at first because I kept trying to use my finger on the screen like a phone. I got used to it. I'm buying different watch bands to accessorize it up!
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|August 7, 2016|For a cheaper smartwatch, this is a good choice.|This was my first 'Smart watch' purchase, and I bought solely based on what my sister said about her pebble. Pro: It has a very long battery life, it's water resistant to 100 meters (~333 feet) It has a nice selection of apps that can be installed to the watch itself as well as some very nice watch faces. Con: It is not touch screen, it does not display emoji's correctly (they look more ASCI, then the modern ones), replying to text messages does not always work and when it does Google seems to get confused as to what you said (this might be Google's fault) example would be when you say the name Cassie, it interprets it as Cathy. Also the pebble app is a real pain to setup, as it asks you 3 different times what language you want (overkill to me)
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|December 10, 2016|Smart watch fun|I like but face a bit small and backlight too dem but other than that light weight and works good so far.  Wish it had sound vibrates all the time.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|July 26, 2016|Working but not sure if it is set up t work the way I want.|I finally got my watch set up.  I want to try another watch face but can not for some reason.  I also taped some notifications, but all it said was "system app"...does this mean that the notification is ON or OFF ?  The Alarm notification is important to me. Update:  I was able to get my new watch face...good...my watch woke me up today...but why only today...?  I do not understand why only today
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|February 10, 2016|Nice watch for the money|Nice watch for the money! I'd love to be able to tweak it more but the basics are indeed present... Also small learning curve for do's & don'ts to minimize heavy battery drain. For example watch faces that poll for the weather temp or have continual animation will definitely drain the battery at stronger rate than a simple analog watch face with out the second-hand.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|December 1, 2016|Great watch for everyone.  Waterproof and long battery life...|I love my pebble.  There is no other color smartwatch on the market that has such a long battery life, has a microphone, is completely waterproof and does all the basics(Pedometer, notifications<email, texts, apps, etc), calendar, tells time, etc.).  It is very light weight and super comfortable. I would highly recommend putting a bezel sticker and screen protector on front to protect it from scratches.(i.e. slick wraps or gadget wraps) I prefer the buttons over a touch screen as my old moto 360 was always accidentally being activated. If you are looking for a perfect basic fitness watch that is waterproof, has a long battery life...This is it. My only complaints are that the screen isn't vivid and bright but that is what gives it such a long battery life.  Hopefully the newer model will fix that.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|October 29, 2016|Approved. 10/10 would buy again.|Approved. 10/10 would buy again. Wish the screen were a little bigger, bezel a little smaller , etc. I have found the sleep tracker to be especially helpful. I especially like that I can read it at night with a quick flick of my wrist and the watchface I am using a easy to read - ima bout blind. I also like the alarm vibe that tickles you awake. For what it is and what I use it for, at this price point  - it's a smart choice.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|October 16, 2015|Great watch. Works just as it should.|So here is how I rate things: 5= Exceeds expectations 4= Meets 3= Below 2= Very poor, major issues 1= Totally worthless. Have not had this for very long, but it works just as expected. The battery lasts for several days without needing a charge and most of the apps and notifications work as you would expect them too. The only minor thing that actually works out in my favor is that the watch will not vibrate when recieveing a message from a group text. I actually like this so that my wrist is not vibrating like crazy when people are talking, but I don't feel like this was part of the design, but rather a flaw that kinda works out.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|February 6, 2017|Can Set 10 Alarms that Vibrates|Its a cool watch and it's thin.  I bought it thinking I could set a lot of vibrating alarms for my son to go off throughout his classes to get him to focus. You can only set up to 10 alarms. But I put the snooze on for 10 minutes. That would've worked perfectly if my son hit the zzzz instead of the X. The.other smart watches the alarms will only sound no vibrate.  It's not a touch screen it works with buttons. It's a duller screen than an LCD screen. But I suppose that's why this watch battery will.keep a charge for a longer time.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|July 10, 2017|I am very pleased with this watch|I am very pleased with this watch! It works great and holds a charge for at least a week. Charging is easy and relatively quick. I would give it 5 stars if it would link with my loseit! app. That is the one thing that' missing.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|July 16, 2016|Best Basic|Love this watch!  It's exactly what I was looking for in a smart watch, basically a pedometer that told the time.  It's also super cute and has a lottle extra than expected like being able to answer texts with voice.  Only reason it doesn't get a perfect 5 is because the firat charger it came with didn't work, but that was resolved quickly through Pebble.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|December 30, 2016|Sucks that they were bought out by FitBit|Sucks that they were bought out by FitBit. Voice recognition no longer works and some issues connecting to iPhones now, but still does what I want it to do. Great bluetooth companion, I never miss a message anymore. Let's hope it holds out.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|May 3, 2017|... a fan of the design but for those who like Pebbles, this is right up your alley|Not a fan of the design but for those who like Pebbles, this is right up your alley!
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|November 12, 2016|Good for boys|I bought the watch for my 12 year old son he loved the watch, easy interface and friendly, the games are cool, cool to be water proof, just lacked being a touch screen.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|June 3, 2016|Good product, Bluetooth music issues|I loved this watch but be warned if you listen to your phone in the car over Bluetooth, having the watch connected while streaming music to a car will make the music skip and jump around. Very annoying. But other than that this is an amazing product. Great interface and good features. It's too bad it can't integrate with the iPhone more.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|May 31, 2016|I think you'll like this watch|I put 4 stars because if you have an android device, I think you'll like this watch. The limitations with the iPhone simply make it not worth the money. If I had At&t or Verizon, so I could respond to texting and messages, it might help, but for me, it wasn't worth the money. I had constant connection issues. The watch would buzz, and I would look down, and the bluetooth was disconnected. Also, the surface of the watch scratches easily. Not the glass, but the band around the glass.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|December 7, 2015|Great Watch, Buy a Scratch Protector|I love the watch. Excellent battery life, typically getting around 4 days before it drops to the low battery warning at 20%. Love that it's water resistant, I don't have to worry washing my hands about accidently destroying my $180 watch. Animations are cutesy. Watchfaces are unique & I love that they can be animated too. The vibration alarm & the different vibration "tones" work great for quickly distinguishing between a call, or notification. The downside is that I've only had the watch for 2 months and it's already got scratches on both the finish around the faceplate and on the glass itself. That's the most disappointing part. 2 months of normal everyday wear and I have to look through scratches to see the time :( I'm going to try a screen protector to prevent further damage, but I'm stuck with what I got. For a smartwatch at $180 when I purchased, I'd have expected a bit stronger scratch resistance.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|0|September 27, 2016|I really like the watch quite a bit|I really like the watch quite a bit. The apps on it are useful and have perfectly fit what I needed in a smart watch. The biggest con is the charging of this phone which is why I give it 4 stars. When I charge the watch it someone's says it is full when it only had 2 days tops for charge. I have to unplug it and plug back in for it to adjust.
B0106IS5XY|4.0|1|August 27, 2016|worth every penny!|I'm new to the smart watch world and this watch has made it so easy to adjust to!  Only cons are that the screen is very dim, which it seems like everyone has this complaint...Also after wearing it for two days without a skin cover on it I collected two scratches on the frame of the watch. You can't answer calls from the watch. Only send text messages out. I'm still learning something new on this watch everyday so as of now that all I can write about it.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|November 1, 2016|Love it|I wanted a small smartwatch that wouldn't overwhelm my small wrists.  I thought this would be a good introduction into smartwatches, since it's relatively inexpensive.  It's actually everything I was looking for in a watch, and I haven't felt the need to get any other smartwatch.  I love the physical buttons, that allow me to dismiss notifications without having to look down.  It's great for text messaging, especially since you can dictate your messages into the little microphone.  I get about 5 days of battery life out of it before charging.  It's actually waterproof, so I wear it in the shower. I've swam with it in the pool and at a lake.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|2|June 6, 2017|This watch is amazing, I also own the HR version|While Pebble has in fact shut down, the rapid price drop has been a welcomed addition. This watch is amazing, I also own the HR version. This one does not have heart rate. Fantastic watch, wouldn't replace it with anything else but a Pebble.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|October 19, 2016|Love my Pebble Time!|I am really loving my Pebble Time! I wanted a watch with a week-long battery life and good functionality and this is exactly what I got. The watch feels great on the wrist and reads well. I mainly use it for reading texts and previewing callers, but I also routinely use the voice function to reply to texts. I also started running again, and it is great in cooperation with my iPhone running app. Love it!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|August 26, 2017|What a great Bluetooth smartphone|What a great Bluetooth smartphone. It syncs easily and stays connected. I really like being able to glance at my txts and e-mails without pulling out my phone. Attractive and lightweight. The rubber strap can make your wrist a bit sweaty if you're outside, but it's worth it.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|4|June 12, 2017|First smartwatch, and only smartwatch! Has made my life so much easier!|I got this watch originally to help me stay connected after shoulder surgery, and I count it as being one of my greatest investments since. Being able to text without having to get uo, get all my emails and messages without having to find my phone, and even send messages for help if I couldn't reach something or needed help from a fall. This watch is simple, yet powerful, and such a great tool - not to mention all the neat apps and faces and designs out there, and I've even been able to design my own watch face that I can see and read without my glasses. Unfortunately the font in the watch itself is very tough to read if one wears (or needs to be wearing) glasses. They may have gone out of business and merged with the (extended dramatic eyeroll) Fitbit, this watch is still every bit as useful and connected in every way that matters. The flood of current or previous Kickstarter backers who still answer questions and design faces and support one another is proof that this watch is now owned by the people, for the people, regardless what company bought it out from under the public's feet.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|September 19, 2017|So happy|I'm so happy with this Smartwatch, i buy the pebble with: ArmorSuit MilitaryShield - Pebble Time Screen Protector [Full Coverage][2 Pack] Anti-Bubble Ultra HD Shield w/ Lifetime Replacements LoveBlue for Pebble time 22mm Magnetic Milanese Loop Stainless Steel Band Replacement Accessories for Pebble/Pebble Time/Pebble Time Steel, Samsung Gear S3 Frontier/Classic(Milanese-Black) It simply looks amazing! Only cons for my is the battery, it only last 4 days.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|January 4, 2017|I love thiswatch|I love this watch, and I'm so disappointed they went out of business. It's got the perfect features at the perfect price point. I used to own an old, original pebble. The uppgrades this offers are a color display, a more stylish appearance, more apps (such as health tracking), and a mic for quick text replies. I especially like the mic, as it solves the problem of not being able to easily reply to texts. Definitely a great addition to and extension of my phone.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|June 7, 2016|Fantastic item. Not a single complaint|Fantastic item. Not a single complaint. Ive had one of the android knockoffs and a moto 360. This blows them out of the water. Long battery life, GPS, water resistance, and voice to text were the main reasons I purchased this, but other apps Im discovering are surprisingly useful and add to its value. The quirkiness of this watch works in its favor, and the e-ink, while not a very high resolution in images, works well enough- especially in the sun- very easy to read- thats something other smartwatch companies cant say about their products. As most smartwatches- this is not meant to be a standalone watch, its an enhancement of your phone. Something to keep in mind. If for some reason mine gets destroyed I wouldnt hesitate to get another pebble time.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|April 25, 2017|A watch before it's time.....|Sad this company got bought out by Fitbit. It is a exceptional functional wrist watch. I almost never have to pull out my phone. Text with voice reply, incoming notifications, reminders, timers, skip the song, pedometer, sleep tracker, small useful apps, and most of all 5 DAYS BATTERY LIFE! Pebble had it right in what a smartwatch should be. Something you don't have to reach for. Right there, plan as can be on your wrist. Gonna miss it...
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|May 29, 2017|Smart...very smart|This is a great smartwatch!! Too bad they sold out to fitbit. Time will tell how much longer there will be support for the Pebble line. It's great not to be interrupted with an annoying text or call. Just A simple alert on your wrist and no one else knows. There are still a great number of apps for the Pebble line, so don't let the fact they sold out keep you from trying this out. The promise was to keep most support going for many years. Time will tell.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|July 24, 2016|I found this to be the best smartwatch option in the market|As of beginning of 2016, I found this to be the best smartwatch option in the market. Superior to Android wear and Apple watch in usability, battery life, water resistance, looks and weight. The software has been designed to not try to replace your smartphone, which all watches are terrible at. So this fills a sweet spot helping you with notifications so you know WHEN to reach your phone and when to carry on with life. It is not an endless source of amusement as fancier smart watches are, but this is a perfect "watch", it should not distract your or have you play games, just help you carry through the day without it being a concern.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|March 30, 2017|Know what you're getting into|The Pebble Time works really great if you don't set the bar high (I was able to buy at $60 - and well worth the price). The first day I thought I might return it - then I realized what it needs to be optimized (at least for iPhone). I wouldn't expect much in terms of Pebble apps - but as a notification machine (with long battery life) for your wrist - it can't be beat. Just make sure your notifications are set to show up on lock/closed screen - and you'll be set by how much you can get out of the watch just using that alone. My only gripe is turn by turn directions on Google Maps (and this may not be entirely Pebble's fault) - Google doesn't seem to notify the last direction (i.e. - arriving at destination on right in 300 ft). Other than that - love it!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|April 7, 2017|Great watch!|Even though Pebble as a company is no more, i love this watch! I run a darkroom and need to time my film processing, this is best watch and timer i have found bar none. I use the Multi Timer app and its been perfect for what i need. Its also a great watch! I bought this one to replace an original Time that was from the kickstarter, i got that one second hand. The original one was a bit beat up when i got it and the vibration motor had problems so i got this replacement.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|September 17, 2017|This is a GREAT watch. Bought it because I kept missing my ...|This is a GREAT watch. Bought it because I kept missing my wife's calls and texts from the phone being in my pocket. Haven't missed a call since I have been wearing my Pebble. The battery life is 4-5 days. Outstanding for a smartwatch.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|March 19, 2017|Wife answers her phone now.|I got this device for my wife. She never answers her phone because it is in her purse. Now that she has this watch she actually picks her phone up. She loves the app selection. Especially the first. Your phone app. Which causes your phone to freak out even if it is on silent. The bands are easy to change out if you don't like the one it comes with.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|October 10, 2016|LOVE LOVE LOVE this watch|LOVE LOVE LOVE this watch!!!!  I sold my Fitbit and got this instead and am so glad I did! It does everything my Fitbit did and more! I have an android phone and it works great with it!! My favorite things about this are the notifications of text messages, Facebook messages, phone calls, and calendar events. I feel so much more organized with it and have quit forgetting events or missing messages! As a Mother or seven, it was a MUST HAVE!!! I can also answer the texts straight from the watch, even if my phone is upstairs! I also LOVE my interval running app. It helped me to finally start running again! The vibration alarm clock is also great. The Fitbit I had before, would not always wake me up. This always does! I charge it just while in the shower and it never runs out of charge! I seriously don't want to be without one now!!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|2|March 20, 2016|Amazon Prime was absolutely great in delivery|I bought the Pebble after a lot of deliberation and also tried other sites. Amazon Prime was absolutely great in delivery. As far as the watch is concerned it's great! It's not for those who like swanky timepieces but more for those who prefer utility. I can answer all my notifications. The voice response is very accurate. The battery life is great too, lasts more than 5 days of moderate usage. Presently, loving it!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|2|April 12, 2017|Nice Watch|So far has been a awesome watch. Biggest thing I went for on this watch was how long the battery lasted compared to most other watches and last pretty long though like anything with a battery not sure how long in general the battery's lifespan.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|April 24, 2016|Love it|Wow, that about sums it up, if your one of those that thinks the iWatch is just too bulky and over priced, if you don't need anything but a watch that always has the perfect time, and will alert you if you have texts and notifications, this is your watch, not to mention the time is always displayed, because it doesn't have a power hungry LED screen that needs to go to sleep to save battery power, need to see the display in the dark, just give your wrist a quick flick and a back light comes on for a few seconds. And there's plenty of watch faces you can download to your phone for free, I've been through many looking fr one that just right for me, time, date, weather, and with two flicks of my wrist, it displays a stock market price of a stock I own, but the best thing I like is its low, it doesn't stick up on my wrist like an iWatch would, it's sleek and low, oh and the silicone band is SO comfortable, for the price you can't go wrong. Yes it's display is in color, but it's not going to display the colors like you will see them on your phone, there a bit muted. Also it never has any Blutooth connection problems, and I mean never, I've had it over a month, and as long as my phone is within 30 feet or so, it's linked.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|September 6, 2017|It's too bad Pebble went out of business|It's too bad Pebble went out of business.  The big attraction to me is that the Pebble will go almost a week without recharging.  I have the Samsung Gear, that although a nicer looking watch and more feature laden, has to be charged every day.  And the Samsung is not unique in that respect everyone I know who has a smart watch has the same issue - they need to be charged daily.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|5|December 24, 2016|Yes Pebble is out of business, but the watches still work great (for now at least)...|++++Yeah, Pebble the company has gone bankrupt, so be aware of this before ordering.++++ However I'm a computer guy so I ordered one anyway. I loved my Pebble Classic and was afraid these would be pulled from sale or the price would go up once they started to run out. Plus it's already only half the original $150 price and it works great (like the original, but color). As of this writing (12/24/16) the app still functions so the watches work fine. This could possibly change sometime in the future as the app requires you to create a Pebble account before it will connect to the watch (or do anything). But they do have a very big user-developer following, so hopefully they will be able to keep things running and Fitbit will let them (and/or not go out of their way to shut things down). ***** Update ***** On April 4, 2017 the Pebble app was updated to no longer require or use any cloud based services in order for the watches to function. They now get all info such as weather, location etc., directly from your smartphone. This means the watches will continue to have full functionality regardless of any online presence.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|August 15, 2017|Buy for the alarm - the rest is a bonus|I bought this watch because the reviews built this unit up as a great "silent" alarm. I wake up at 4:45am and my wife doesn't wake up until 8am every day. However, I'm such a deep sleeper that every morning my alarm wakes her up before it will ever wake me up - a pattern which she's not terribly fond of. This morning I used the Pebble Time watch for the first time and woke up IMMEDIATELY with the watch alarm on silent. There was no sound, simply vibration. This is a game changer. The watch is comfortable and if it did nothing other than provide a very strong vibrating alarm, it would be the best $60 I've spent in a long time.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|July 31, 2016|Great value smartwatch for the price|Simple, lightweight, water resistant smartwatch for people who don't need bells and whistles. The build quality is solid, low power consumption and good app/phone support. Keep in mind the price-point for this product - e.g. this particular Pebble watch is not a competitor to the Apple Watch or Samsung smartwatches and you won't find the usability to match those products, however this watch is 1/3 the price and I think the value is fantastic for the price. This watch does the simple "wrist companion" very well with good activity/sleep tracking, notifications from your phone, microphone support and a cool color e-ink display that is very sharp and low power. I would STRONGLY recommend third-party protection for the watch face as the metal bezel probably scratches very easily. I recommend GadgetWraps screen/bezel protectors (they make good replacement bands too).
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|September 30, 2016|Way more useful than I thought it'd be|Way more useful than I thought it'd be. I love the apps and silly animations (didnt think I would but it really grows on you). Great battery life. I can't tell you how many hours it lasts because I lose track after a few days and charge it when I think of it. Very light. I forget its even there. Waterproof for real! Ive been in the ocean in pools and the shower with no probs. Great watch and a great deal for a hundred and something bucks! 5 stars all day
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|July 6, 2017|Love this watch|Love this watch.  Does everything I want it to.  Shows notifications and works well with my iPhone 7.  Highly recommended if you want a smart watch but do not want to spend as much as a Samsung gear or a iWatch
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|April 8, 2016|Happy with the Pebble!😄|So far after 2 days of using, I love the watch! It does what I wanted it for! My notifications come in right away, I hear my phone and the watch will nudge me! I have noticed that my backlight doesn't light every time I push a button, but I think that is because I drive and move my arm a lot and activates the backlight too much! But it does work while I'm still! I don't use anymore apps then what was on it! The health app seems to be pretty accurate on my steps, and that does shock me! I just hope it keeps working for a long time with no issues! I am running the watch on android marshmallow and it stays connected with the instructions that I was given!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|April 29, 2017|Great watch!|So far I love this watch. I'm using it with an iPhone 6s and so far it has paired perfectly and works great. It is a very simple smartwatch. No frills. But that is what I was looking for. Also the fact that it can get wet really appeals to me. I can shower in it and jump in a pool for a swim no problem! It shows my calendar events and text messages. I highly recommend!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|June 22, 2017|I have to say this is the BEST smart watch I have ever had|I have to say this is the BEST smart watch I have ever had! You can text, track steps, check emails and a lot of other things. The price is great, and in my opinion under priced. I have had a fitbit, that died after 2 years, and I paid $150.00. This is way better than that watch! I highly recommend this watch.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|July 17, 2017|Great watch|my first go at smart watches and i really like this one. i didnt want the Apple watch due to the price and im hard on watches. This one seems to take the abuse just fine and stays charged longer than the iWatches do. It lacks alot of the iWatches features but none that i really wanted. Loads of bands out there for it and it looks good. I did put a screen protector and carbonfiber skin on mine. The pebble software on the phone is easy to use and straight forward as is most of the apps (gets kinda wierd with some weather apps)
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|November 8, 2016|Excellent basic smart watch for active people|The Pebble time is exactly as billed, an entry level (by price, not function) non-touchscreen smart watch that is excellent for young active users. I bought this smart watch for my daughter because it is compatible with both iOS and android and will run the apps needed for her Dexcom glucose monitor. One of the main selling points was the 30meter water resistance, however, the first watch died in 3 days after getting wet in the shower. There appeared to be a leak/poorly sealed connection between the face and body. Amazon was fantastic and immediately replaced the watch. Absolutely no problems with the replacement, even swimming with it to a depth of 10 feet
B0106IS5XY|5.0|2|September 24, 2016|Awesome Smartwatch|Now I bought a used one, but this is an awesome smart watch either way. It hooks up flawlessly with an iPhone, which is what I use, but it will also hook to an android phone just fine too. There is no windows phone support but that isn't that big of an issue. This watch receives every notification from my phone just fine and has never missed one, and the color E-Ink display is amazing. There is absolutely no glare to speak of in this screen and even in direct sunlight you can still see the screen just fine. It also has a microphone for limited voice assistance and with certain cell phone carriers, you can even reply to text messages straight from the watch. It also has apps to control certain aspects of your phone like music. I would highly recommend this watch for anyone who has an iPhone or an Android phone.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|May 23, 2016|What a Time to own a Pebble Time!|I absolutely love my Pebble Time! I owned and still have my original Pebble and I figured it was TIME to upgrade (no pun intended). I love the new firmware and color ePaper  screen. Also the build quality has increased from the first gen Pebble; less plastic, a metal face and just a cleaner and more subtle look overall. I love that I can now sync my Google Fit with my Pebble Time, and the built in Pedometer is much more accurate. Another pleasing feature is that it has a sleep monitor which is surprisingly accurate. It estimate my sleep time down almost to the exact minute. Other than the new features, color screen and faster processor it's still the Pebble that everyone knows which is the simplistic, intuitive and useful companion to all smartphones!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|August 25, 2017|more to come|a perfect imitation apple iWatch it doesn't have all the same features but still acts the same.  It's blutooth enabled to work well with your iphones.  thou I don't have much faith in the wrist band.  I think it might be great but I don't know if it will last a very long time.  More to come when I give it to my little brother as a birthday gift
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|July 7, 2016|Affordable, simple, and inexpensive.|I read about this watch on an article about successful Kickstarter campaigns. And it is everything they advertised it to be. It is an affordable, simple, and aesthetically pleasing smartwatch. With the simple included instructions I was easily able to get my Pebble set up and running in no time. It holds a charge for about 4 days (May vary based on usage, and watch face animation) and charges fully in a few short hours. I am very satisfied with what I got. 5/5
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|April 29, 2016|and I've been doing my best about not playing incessantly on it to detract from ...|Battery life is a little less than expected, and I've been doing my best about not playing incessantly on it to detract from what the average life would be. It seems to run on average about 3-3.5 days, though what it does in that time makes it well worth it. Let's make this as simple as possible; If you're one of those guys (or girls) who's friends acknowledge that calling you will get nothing done because you will not answer, this is the device for you. I can take a glance at my phone when I feel the tell-tale signs of an incoming call from my pocket, and see the name and easily just choose to move on with my day sans that person. Text messages? Psh. You can set up the canned response "Go away." and solve that problem one instance at a time! For the procrastinator, the plan-flaker, this is ideal. Also, you know, if you like getting notifications, controlling your music, news, weather, etc.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|September 1, 2016|but I absolutely love it! It's much easier to keep track of ...|I got this not expecting much for the price, but I absolutely love it! It's much easier to keep track of my steps with it than with my phone, and the wake up function has me waking up in a much better mood. I love the sleep tracker, I've been able to use it to show my doctors so that they can help me with my prescriptions. I'm a college student, and don't like checking my phone during class, but am worried about missing emergency calls. This has helped my anxiety so much! I just got an update on it today, so even though it's an older model, they're still providing support for it, which is awesome. Definitely recommend, especially for the price.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|February 22, 2017|True quality-of-life improvment device. Never been happier with a purchase.|I have had this smartwatch for almost a month now. Even though Pebble Technology is gone, that doesn't mean their products are not worth buying. This is still the best all-rounder smartwatch available on the market. It has lasted at least 5 1/2 days per charge, with a record of 7 days 3 hours once. I wish more smartwatch manufactures abandoned the idea of making a smartwatch that was just a smartphone with a smaller screen and weaker battery. In my opinion, a smartwatch is not a stand alone device, but an extension of your smartphone. It's not meant to have a full color HD display, it's job is for quick notifications and alerts while giving you the option of controlling your phone without taking it out of your pocket when on the move. If I have any problems with this watch in the next 5 months, I will update this review. I doubt it though.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|March 22, 2017|Pebble Time Smartwatch Works for Me|It may seem strange to purchase a smartwatch from a company that no longer exists, but I wanted a reasonably priced watch that would send vibe notifications from my iPhone. The Pebble Smartwatch meets the bill. It looks good. It has a battery life of about 3-4 days. The company may be gone but the watch is still good and it works. The future is hard to predict but for the price it is a good deal!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|September 10, 2017|It was proabalby the right mix of function for a smartwatch. Get them while you can.|Yes the company is gone, and the servers could stop working any day, but it was a really good smart watch for the price, the biggest reason being it wasn't trying to do too much and it had the right display tech for a watch. I really don't understand why they were the only ones to use the e-ink screens.  You can always see the display, the light worked great for when there wasn't ambient light, and it's plenty responsive enough for whatever you were doing on your watch.  The fact you can get 3 or 4 days of battery life from it should have made it the standard. I like that it wasn't trying to replace my phone, it does the activity/sleep tracking stuff that most people wanted, and displays notifications and such, and even allows simple replies.  I loved that it worked with my running app to show stats and allow me to pause my workout too.  I wasn't sure I would like or use a smart watch but honestly I bought this one as a backup in case my current one dies.  Eventually Fitbit may come out with the spiritual successor to the the Pebble, but until then I'll just have to hope these survive.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|April 24, 2016|Great Smart Watch!!!|I have now had this watch for about 4 months and I love it!!! I have come to rely on it as an alarm (it vibrates instead of waking the whole house up with noise). This is a great watch for someone that does a lot of driving or cannot pull his/her phone out every five minutes. You can read texts and e-mails right from your watch and respond verbally, so your not spending your time logging into your phone to send a "yes" text or e-mail. Like I said, I love this watch!!! I am allergic to metal and hadn't owned a watch in a couple of decades. This watch gives me no issues. The battery lasts anywhere from 3.5 to 6 days for me as I use it a lot. One concern I do have is that the watch face scratches easily. My suggestion there is to get a protective screen cover. If you want a good smart watch at a great price, I suggest this one!!!!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|4|March 26, 2016|Nice watch! Worth the money|Bought this for my 14 yr old son. He loves it, it stays charged for several days. He likes the fact that you don't have to move your arm like the Apple Watch to look at the time. Looks very nice not to bulky.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|September 2, 2017|Better smart WATCH than anything else out there|I love the pebble watch. I have worn the more expensive gear watches and many other lesser ones, but my go to watch for keeping me informed and looking good is the pebble. I love the functionality better than any of the other ones. It is a watch first with just enough notification display to be great at it's job. Thank you Pebble. Get one while you can.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|March 24, 2017|Good buy!!!|This went on sale, and I decided to take advantage of it. I had been watching the price of this watch for sometime, and I'm glad that I waited to buy it.  It connected to my iPhone easily, and I had no issue setting it up. They have different customization options that allow you to really make it your own. The battery life is amazing, I only have to charge it maybe twice a week. Great investment.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|2|September 25, 2016|Tells time, notifies and battery last for days.|For a watch that can be found under a $100, it does what I want. What I was looking for was a smartwatch that tells time, notifies me on who's calling, receive text messages, and notifications from apps that I choose I want to be notified from. They have other cool features but those I mentioned were the most important to me. A really big plus on this watch is the battery life. So far I got 5 days and 10 hours. I'm sure I could have gotten more but I didn't want to risk my watch die on me while I'm out and about.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|March 6, 2017|A simple, effective, reliable smart watch with non of the extra's I don't need|I have had multiple smart watches (Asus, Motorola, and the original Pebble) and I truly believe this is the best smart watch for me. I have no internist in having a speaker phone on my watch, so even though a lot of people think that is a short coming of the Pebble watches, I think it helps keep the Pebble's price down. It does not have the same screen tearing problem that the original Pebble's got after a year or two.  The Pebble Time is a very reliable and sturdy watch, which is a good thing since the Pebble company does not exist anymore (bought and dismantled by Fit Bit).
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|July 2, 2017|Still a valid option!|Considering the price and the features (10 mts. water proof, apps variety, battery life), I consider the Pebble Time the better smartwatch for Android OS.  Beware of using Android 7.0 because it messed up ALL SMARTWATHC notifications (not just Pebble).  With Android 6 (Marshmellow) the Pebble work just fine.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|August 28, 2017|Getting a watch dedicated to a smart phone is hard nowadays because most people only have ...|We all know Pebble as a company went bankrupt but this watch I believe is definitely worth the price. I have only had it for a month and I feel as if I got my $50 use out of it. Getting a watch dedicated to a smart phone is hard nowadays because most people only have their phones for a short period of time then switch to the next best phone out there. This watch is perfect because you can use it with whichever phone you would like and it will work great!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|October 10, 2016|Love IT!|Great, works as expected. Large selection of apps and even games, and due to its buttons instead of a touch display, the ui is able to be the best of any smart watch I have looked at.  It also allows for games to be played with ease. Voice detection work 8/10 times but if it's not your thing you can make custom canned messages. It pushes every notification from any app as long as you allow the apps through the app.  (all apps are enabled automatically) the always on screen work well in lit areas, people complained about angles but the way you look at your watch doesn't effect how well the time reads, the only time angle effects readability is when you testing the angles, so for use, it's brilliant.
B0106IS5XY|5.0|1|July 6, 2017|I love this watch|I love this watch. It does the things I like about an Apple Watch without the price tag. I hope Fitbit will continue to support it, but for the price it's been a fantastic watch!!
B0106IS5XY|5.0|0|July 11, 2016|It's amazing|UPDATE!!! FITBIT HAS BOUGHT AND KILLED PEBBLE.  SUPPORT WILL END SOON. Dude,  it's awesome. It's waterproof, the face is always on and the battery lasts several days on a charge. I turned the brightness and vibration all the way up with 8 second LED timeout and the battery still lasted about four days, even playing games and using it a lot. I'm glad that this is only about as big as a regular watch,  it's smallish. It's cool not having facebook and web browser.  I love this thing so far.  It loses connection sometimes but re-connection usually not hard. Update: I have had my ringer off since I got this thing ^__^ LOVE IT Never walking around like a zombie with my phone seemingly guiding me through life.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|August 23, 2017|Wanna love it but cant 😭😭😭😭😭|Would love to have been able to enjoy it but was sent a defective console, otherwise I couldn't see why people go gaga over this thing. Had a Day 1 PS4, didn't keep it cause interface wasn't pleasant and there weren't many games that weren't on the current generations systems that I already had. Fast forward to this bundle, on Prime Day which was also my birthday this was on sale, wanted to give it another go so I bought it.  Got it that friday, finally had a chance that Sunday night to play and sadly I was greeted with that same interface from long ago. Ok, I guess this layout is acceptable to some, oh well right. Well, I picked up Infamous Second Son used and for wifey I grabbed Little Big Planet new. Infamous starts to load like you'd expect, game commences, I'm playing about 15 minutes in, yada yada fighting guy in building then "Plink!!", I'm being sent to the home screen. I'm like uuuugh??????? Huh??? Ok, restart my game, same crap but I got about 40 minutes in this time. Thought maybe bad controller, so I grabbed my friends and same result, Game was updated online, factory sealed until, and Little Big Planet was brand spanking new. Was able to return console no problem but I had opened a new game that I bought from a certain store that primarily sells video games. It must have been meant for me not to own a PS4 because when I happened to go to return Infamous and Little Big Planet it also happened to be this one employees last day there and her experience with that company wasn't as pleasant as she hoped so she kindly gave me a full refund....even though she wasn't supposed to. If it wasn't because I really enjoy the Infamous series so much, I wouldn't really care for a PS4. I'll probably grab one in a few years once they reach the $150 price for the Super Duper Ultra Lightning Babe Slim PS4 version.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|July 12, 2017|System Interface Is Not User Friendly|I replaced the family Xbox 360 with this, believing it was the better option compared to the Xbox One S, but now I think I may the wrong decision. My issues with the PS4: -Many games will not work with "local accounts", they require PSN accounts. -There's no screen that displays all active downloads. -There's no option to cancel a download. -Purchased, but not yet downloaded game cannot be removed from the Library. -Built-in apps cannot be removed. -The main screen is bloated with unnecessary apps. -Apps are added in a single horizontal row while leaving a ton of screen space below it. As long as this is the default interface, I will never again purchase or recommend a PlayStation. I could return it or sell it on eBay, but then I lose all the money I invested in the digital games - so I'm kind of stuck between a rock and hard place. I may just bite the bullet and cut my losses by returning/selling it and buying an Xbox One S.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|March 23, 2017|Still not good enough|An improvement over PS3 graphics. And a slightly smoother user interface. But as glitchy as ever. My system frequently crashes for no apparent reason. I get a message of "too many Bluetooth devices connected". There are no Bluetooth devices connected. I have 1 controller using the USB cable. The controller seems to lose it's charge very quickly when going wireless. And often is unresponsive when connected via the cord. It's hard to believe after this many years and 4 editions of the PS; they still can't get it right. Such a rip off.
B01LRLJV28|2.0|0|March 9, 2017|Buy an Xbox instead.|It's great if you never want to play anything on optical media. If you only plan to download games onto the hard drive, then it's perfect. If you plan to use the disc drive, buy an Xbox. I will never purchase another Sony product ever again. This console has let me down for the last time. Every single time I try to play a game on disc, I get an 'unrecognized disc' error. The discs are FLAWLESS, so it's definitely the console hardware our software. I've been told that I should download the games I can't play on disc, but why would I want to buy something I already own? This hunk of garbage is barely under warranty, so I'll post an update if Sony actually fixes it.
B00NIYJF6U|2.0|0|April 7, 2015|google freezing problem before you buy one|I was so stoked to buy a GOPRO camera because they are supposed to be rugged. Well I wouldnt know because I havent taken mine outside yet and it is already broken. I started to get these pink lines in the LCD screen and then it just freezes up. You have to remove the battery to turn it off. I figure no big deal its brand new I'll just send it back. When my new one arrives it is doing the same thing after about 3 hours. I am now waiting on my  3rd camera in the mail. GOPRO has excellent tech support and sent me a new camera right away so we will see what happens next but.... All I can tell you is that make sure you get a micro SD card from GOPRO's recommended list. The speed of the card is very important. I'm not sure if my card corrupted both cameras (which i have never heard of before) or if I got 2 faulty cameras so far. I ordered a new sandisk extreme 64 gig card to try with my new camera. Fingers crossed. Not that it really matters. the vacation I bought this camera for came and went a month ago.  Before you buy this camera Google GoPro freezing problems.... I'm not the only one with this problem.  I'll update this review to let you know how it all plays out.
