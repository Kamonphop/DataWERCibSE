"Really great product but it's not ready for prime time, the software looks more like a beta version, still missing a lot of basic features and settings.",Complaint,
"Yo can't change the info on the home screen,  Another HUGE issue is that only works with a US address, our company has an office in South America and another one in Europe and I usually work in those offices a few months a year and the Echo Show is a big NO if you try to use it oversees, I work for a tech company so I know it's extremely easy for Amazon to allow to enter a city or state that is not in the US for the local weather and other features.",Complaint,
I will change my review to 5 stars once they fix all these issues and they make the OS more user friendly and allow us to fully customize the home screen and other features to better suit our needs.,Complaint,

They have other cool features but those I mentioned were the most important to me.,Praise,
"This works mostly ok.  You'll want to pair it with a better speaker if you plan to listen to music, but it's fine as an alarm clock or reminder.",Praise,

GoPro needs to build in heavy duty image stabilization for a piece of equipment like this at the cost we pay.,Feature Request,

I bought it thinking I could set a lot of vibrating alarms for my son to go off throughout his classes to get him to focus.,Complaint,
You can only set up to 10 alarms.,Feature Summary,
That would've worked perfectly if my son hit the zzzz instead of the X. The.other smart watches the alarms will only sound no vibrate.,Complaint,

Searching the net I was able to find multiple lists of Echo commands that have made the device more of a friendly helper than a novelty item.,Praise,

I loved that it worked with my running app to show stats and allow me to pause my workout too.,Praise,
It is a very useful workout tool and is pretty accurate with the readings.,Praise,
"Returned, images were unacceptable.",Complaint,
The fact that you can't clear all the history at once is so annoying that I've almost completely stopped using this device.,Complaint,
Amazon is making is nearly impossible and totally inconvenient for you to delete your data...why?,Complaint,
I'm personally not happy when software becomes non user friendly because it is  advantageous for the corporation.,Complaint,
"I love being able to set timers, alarms, hear the news, and add things to my grocery or to-do list, all with my voice.",Praise,
It's also handy for checking the weather to know how to dress for the day.,Praise,

"All you need is: - Hotspot - Either use your phone or install a permanent hot spot into your vehicle such as the Verizon Hum+ or similar solution by other carriers - USB power for the Echo Dot - Aux in for the car radio is what I use in both our vehicles It's fun to have Alexa on the go now, and we're hooked on the home automation integration we've been able to do with it.",Praise,
"Our entire home can be controlled by Alexa from opening/closing the garage door, to setting the security (we don't allow her to disarm), turning on the main water feed through via the watercop system we have, controlling all the lights in the house, and putting the projector screen down and turning on the projector in our home theater when it is movie time, to name a few things.",Feature Summary,
Looking forward to Alexa having better information search capability but they keep adding features and this has closed the gap on mainstream home automation to the masses.,Feature Request,
Its no good if you can't use all the features and keep the battery life.,Complaint,
You have to shut all of the features off to keep the battery life sufficient.,Feature Summary,
I don't use any of the extra features because I will have to charge it daily if I do.,Feature Summary,

"Also, another feature that could have been added is, based on the history of all the search a user has done, can alexa start a conversation with the user when needed, something like I was searching for a product and I would like to know when it becomes available, instead of an email, Alexa starting a conversation would be better too..",Feature Request,
Camera overheated -Helicopter noise after recording with the wifi on and then downloading onto my phone -I spent two hours messing with my camera and trying to connect it to wifi.,Bug Report,

The unit was easy to setup and the mic picks up commands from a good distance out.,Praise,
"Overall it feels like it's got great potential but out of the box, the only use I've found from it is telling me the weather and giving me news briefings (and telling a joke, which has been surprisingly good).",Praise,
I wish there was more content out of the box or perhaps have a better way to seamlessly engage with it.,Feature Request,
It feels like I need to read up on what commands it would take before I can really make use of the Echo.,Complaint,

It does not have to update often thankfully.,Praise,
"The 5-10 minute update process took over 90 minutes to complete last week, and it was that long actually out of the box when I set it up too, but I have had zero problems with it since purchase.",Praise,
I would have given this camera a 5 star rating is the use of the camera was a little more intuitive.,Feature Request,
I have 3 professional model dslr cameras and they are easier to use when compared to the Go Pro.,Complaint,
The watch seems to track my steps and my sleep pattern very well.,Praise,
The companion app with IOS hasn't given me any trouble yet.,Praise,
I am enjoying a couple of games very much and using the controller is intuitive Uncharted 4 is a blast to play also!,Praise,
My only complaint is the Alexa android app is a piece of crap that really needs work.,Complaint,
"It is extremely difficult to get it to pair, it constantly has errors, the user interface is horrendous, the app fails constantly (iPhone version), and the watch face is really hard to see without the backlight on.",Bug Report,
"First, Alexa forces you to upload your *entire* contact list even if you have no intention of calling many of these people via Alexa.",Complaint,
Why does Amazon need to know everyone I've ever spoken with when all I want is a video chat with the grandparents?,Inquiry,
"Second, Alexa rings all devices simultaneously that are linked to the same phone number.",Feature Summary,
"Leaving aside that a device that sits in my kitchen shouldn't even require a mobile number to function, if my kids want to call their grandparents' Echo Show, it's not good for that to also ring my father's phone (usually while he's at work).",Complaint,
Why not allow calling only to the Show?,Feature Request,
"At least Amazon finally added contact blocking, but even that initial lapse showed a stunning lack of attention to basic privacy and functionality.",Complaint,
I love that I can read my text messages and see who is calling through the screen.,Praise,
I love that I can select exercises and just do it with the watch.,Praise,
"For as long as the Echo has been out -- and the number of independent communities around uses for it that exist, you'd think Amazon would have advanced the capabilities by now.",Feature Request,
"There is no thought to owning multiple units and the heavily dependence on referring to the Alexa App (for more on that, see the app; to clear your lists, see the app).",Complaint,
"It's a nice toy but I have yet to find a useful application for it, the Echo Dot did not work with the brand of wifi connected thermostat I had installed in my house, also Alexa only understands English which is fine for me, but not for my in laws.",Complaint,
"I can get it to play whatever music I like from several sources Pandora Radio, SiruisXM, Amazon music or my own music collection, I can set an alarm or check the weather.",Feature Summary,
Continual issues with turning on and off and locking up.,Bug Report,
"I could get some to connect to it with 'classic' mode, but it wouldn't actually DO anything (not even teh music like it's supposed to) really unhappy with it.",Bug Report,
It's easy to read and see.,Praise,
If I would have went with the black i would be disappointed because without the LCD the GoPro is a little hard to navigate.,Praise,
"You can also choose from a number of different interfaces on the watch screen, so you can make it appeal to your own personal taste.",Feature Summary,
Bought this in mid July of 2017 and it has already stopped working with a lot of error messages on the screen.,Bug Report,
"Forget about using its running feature, 9 times out of 10, it will tell you it cannot find your phone!",Bug Report,
Alexa is a really great timer & weather informant.,Praise,
In order to find out information like 'How much is half of 1 1/2 cup' for a recipe or 'what is an alternative for baking soda' or other basic questions you have to download apps.,Feature Summary,
Then you have to remember the name of the associated app with your question.,Feature Summary,
Everything you want to ask it has a different associated app and I don't have time to remember that many apps.,Complaint,
I use Alexa as a glorified timer and end up Googling everything else.,Complaint,
I will be getting the Google version of Alexa that will let me ask pretty much whatever I want without additional apps.,Feature Request,
The device did take time to load as it was downloading an update.,Feature Summary,
Alexa started introducing the device and features.,Feature Summary,
"Here are skills that we use daily, timers: such ease, no need to poke around on your phone.",Praise,
YouTube trailers:Alexa shows a notification as soon as a new trailer comes out and immediately plays it if prompted.,Feature Summary,
Music requires a little effort and needs clear enunciation when band or song names are similar to another.,Feature Summary,
I wish Alexa could handle context questions better.,Feature Request,
"Also, I have pandora, spotify and prime, yet she can not play a specific song for me, only a sample.",Complaint,
It says ASUS isn't on their list of supported phones but an older ASUS phone connected fine just like my mother in laws IPhone did.,Praise,
"They only thing is that I can not start a new text, they have canned message that you can use to reply or you can use your voice.",Bug Report,
Everytime I try to talk into it it never u derstands what I'm saying.,Complaint,
It alerts me on calls and messages.,Feature Summary,
The best feature of the Show is the video calling and texting.,Praise,
"fitness tracking, notifications for calls/texts, tracking sleep), was always connected to Bluetooth like promised.",Praise,
"Soon after, the watch would stop connecting to my iPhone and the app -- which lost some data in the moments that it stopped working.",Bug Report,
Now I have a hard time with the basic functions of it.,Complaint,
"Received the GoPro Hero 4 silver, with manufacturing defects does not work, to use the recommendation of the manufacturer had to buy a brand Lexar model 633x memory, I was able to upgrade the software and igualmanera still did not work, from the first day the camera it stays in the start menu and does not recognize the rest of the commands, I tried restarting of all forms and the camera does not work, additionally the camera when I arrived note that in one of the corners of the front frame right supeior was broken.",Bug Report,
So I've had this for a week and the first thing I realize is the brightness of the watch is not that good that being said the color also is not very good and the size is small a little hard to see that part is two stars maybe even one star the band has a good feeling to it and paring with a iPhone 6 Plus is good I get all my texts and messages and phone calls that I can see before I look at my phone and there is no ring tones just a vibration I give that 3 stars I'm in construction so most of the apps are stupid .so I think it's a little pricey for what you get also the charger can fall off easy.you have to have pebbles on your phone so the watch will work well know it stopped pairing with my iPhone 7 plus,Complaint,both complains and praise
"Its a great, inexpensive alternative to the Apple Watch and has some wonderfully convenient features.",Praise,
I love the variety of watch faces and the ability to quickly check a text message with tracking down my phone while I'm in a meeting is priceless.,Praise,
The only 'problem' to speak of so far is unreliable Bluetooth connection but I can usually remedy the problem by forgetting both connection and re-pairing the watch to my iPhone.,Bug Report,
I wouldn't expect much in terms of Pebble apps - but as a notification machine (with long battery life) for your wrist - it can't be beat.,Praise,
Just make sure your notifications are set to show up on lock/closed screen - and you'll be set by how much you can get out of the watch just using that alone.,Feature Summary,
My only gripe is turn by turn directions on Google Maps (and this may not be entirely Pebble's fault) - Google doesn't seem to notify the last direction (i.e.,Complaint,
Needs more integrations and it needs to work better.,Feature Request,
"For example, I cannot seem to find a simple command for Echo to tell me what my Honeywell thermostat is set to,  I can change it up and down, it just won't report the current setting.",Bug Report,
"For example, when in location '1' and I want to change the temperature, it should default to the thermostat co=located with the Show device I am speaking to.",Feature Request,
Then it could require more specific instructions if I want to change the thermostat in the other location.,Feature Request,
"Also, integration with Ring cameras is sporadic at best.",Complaint,
"Sometime it shows them, sometimes it doesn't, even when the Ring App itself is able to show them.",Bug Report,
"In addition, I would expect to be able to have more customization available for the Home Screen such as showing the current date along with weather conditions and forecast.",Complaint,
It just not working right  I get it  a command but it just doesn't respond like support to,Bug Report,
I like the interface and how easy it was to sync it up to an online account once established.,Praise,
"The only thing that might annoy someone is that if you say anything with the word 'Alexa' in it, then it responds.",Feature Summary,
"I like the random info it gives & while we intended to use it mainly as a clock/radio, we regularly ask for a joke, put together shopping lists, to-do lists & set timers.",Praise,
However when deep underwater I got the green tint - sometimes- I guess in software white balance but really it ruined the video and I can't seem to take out that saturation in post.,Bug Report,
So every time when I try to resync it I have to delet my device from apps memory or even reinstall the actual app.,Bug Report,
* Switching back and forth between two modes is a pain.,Complaint,
Got this and used it for about 2 months and then it stopped receiving texts and other notifications.,Bug Report,
One thing... make sure if you already own an Echo that you install your Dot in a location of your home where Echo can't listen in.,Feature Summary,
"Sometimes, a simple command like 'Alexa, set timer for 5 minutes' will be answered by the Echo in the Kitchen while others the Dot around the corner in the Living Room will faintly respond.",Feature Summary,or Complaint?
Alexa is pretty limited in what she knows.,Feature Summary,
"Even Siri can answer more questions, and I don't think of Siri as being all the impressive.",Complaint,
The notifications on it are definitely a huge plus.,Praise,
"You can read texts, see calls and answer them, see calendar things and more!",Feature Summary,
"I really like it, but the one thing that drives me crazy is that it's hit or miss when you go to sync it to your phone.",Bug Report,
"It will sync fine, then for some reason it won't sync no matter what you do.",Bug Report,
I usually have to delete the watch and add it new to trick the phone into thinking it's new...and this usually works.,Bug Report,
This isn't true AI and I won't treat it as such.,Complaint,
"But to be fair, Alexa isn't that bad.",Praise,Can't really tell
"Most of the time, it does what it's suppose to without overdoing the embellishments of simulated conversation.",Praise,
I have an Echo dot positioned near my computer where I watch videos and listen to music so there are a lot of false triggers.,Bug Report,
Most of the time it just turns on and beeps off but sometimes it talks back saying it doesn't understand.,Bug Report,
I wish it would just turn off instead of saying something.,Feature Request,
"I love that you can change the face of the Blaze's screen, change the bands, and track your exercises and sleep pattern with the FitBit.",Praise,
It also reminds me to get up and move if I haven't taken 250 steps within the hour.,Feature Summary,
"I also have it set so if anyone calls or texts me, it'll let me know who's calling and will show me the text as well.",Feature Summary,
"With the app, it also syncs easily with My Fitness Pal.",Praise,
I definitely recommend the Blaze to anyone who is really into fitness and doesn't need all of the other notifications and functions that the Apple Watch provides.,Feature Summary,
Very easy to navigate around the options but one thing I would highly recommend is 'get to know your gopro before your big adventure'.,Praise,
Accessing my Spotify account on the Echo was never a problem but the Show seems to have lots of difficulty.,Bug Report,
For other commands there seems to be a big lag at times and often Alexa tells me that she is having trouble connecting but will still keep trying.,Bug Report,
"As others have mentioned, the continuous scrolls are annoying and would hope they would issue the option to turn those off.",Complaint,
"This FitBit is pretty handy, though it doesn't notify me of any messages or calls even after I've set it up to do so.",Bug Report,
"My only real complaint is that it has a few false positives, sometimes responding to the TV if audio says anything remotely close to 'alexa'.",Complaint,
"Granted you can change the trigger word to something else, but it's just worth noting.",Feature Summary,
"I enjoy wearing the Blaze primarily because of the watch face and menu item selections; however, the back button stopped working after less than one year.",Praise,
Definitely not as flexible as Google home in terms of responding.,Feature Summary,
"Google home has much better potential then Alexa, and doesn't look cheap",Complaint,
From week 2-3 the console would occasionally randomly lock up for several seconds when a game was running and shut off.,Bug Report,
I would always have to plug out the console and restart to use the machine.,Complaint,
"If you have the volume cranked, she may have trouble hearing, but this is typically not an issue.",Feature Summary,
"Pros: Great alarm clock/timer Plays spotify playlists easy for the kids to use Shopping list is nice Cons: Skills are not quite smart enough yet Siri has more answers for things Ecobee control is not intuitive (as are most specialized skills) I would definitely buy this again, and I am thinking about getting more for the house.",Feature Summary,Define both pros and cons
But if you are concerned with 'privacy' you may not want a device in your home that listens to audio in the room and tracks what is being said.,Feature Summary,
I have found the sleep tracker to be especially helpful.,Praise,
I especially like that I can read it at night with a quick flick of my wrist and the watchface I am using a easy to read - ima bout blind.,Praise,
Can't answer detailed questions but knows the basics.,Feature Summary,
"Also, it's annoying when Alexa responds even when it hears it's name from the tv or on a youtube video you may be watching.",Complaint,
Plus it will only play songs you've purchased or have uploaded into your library.,Feature Summary,
It's a great alarm clock and reminder.,Praise,
"No phone support, only the possibility of email advice after a significant time lag.",Complaint,
"You also cannot sync and voice command with your iTunes library on your phone, only Amazon Music, Pandora, SIRUS XM, and a few others.",Feature Summary,
"I can give it a command to play my music, but after that I cannot give other commands and I am told by the device to try later.",Bug Report,
"Within 20 minutes, it stops playing my downloaded music.",Bug Report,
Any attempts to rectify the problem is met with a swirling red light and advises me to try later.,Bug Report,
I have tried to reset it with negative results.,Bug Report,
Not the watch fault but my vision is not so great up close so the text on it was super small.,Complaint,(complaint example)
"Big, bold text and just a better overall smartwatch for me.",Praise,
Sound is ridiculously low but Alexa is very smart,Praise,
Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services.,Feature Summary,
"We don't shop that often, so the usefulness of this device is limited to a voice activated radio, a trivia game, a hard of hearing person who you have to repeat your question to just for the answer to be incorrect.",Complaint,
"The dot was a deal, but I would wait until Amazon has better programming for Alexa, or buy a Google home.",Feature Request,
And it has frozen up on me once but that was a day or two after getting it and hasn't happened since.,Bug Report,
Horrible and useless after initial novelty wears off  Has not acquired any new funtions or learned from use.,Complaint,
The calendar function seems to be lacking in that you can't put an end day of an appointment.,Complaint,
"And when asked to remove all appointments for a particular day, I'm prompted to scroll down, then get a message 'something went wrong.'",Bug Report,
"I wanted this for calendar and scheduling and so far, it gets an F.  Neat getting delivery notices on Amazon products but nothing is updated when delivered.",Bug Report,
"So far I feel like it's just a running of jeopardy type questions (no,I didn't pay $228 to find out what the mass of the moon is and no, I don't want to play a jazz list).",Complaint,
Capabilities seem limited unless you have your entire house installed with Echo devices that can be controlled (I'm not paying several hundred to get an Echo friendly thermostat).,Complaint,
Easy to read clock (when it works right.),Praise,
It won't sync with my computer (syncs okay with IOS)(which is nowhere near when I try to sync with the computer.),Bug Report,
Notifications work well but the ability to send a quick yes or no with a  touch would be helpful in the absence of texting.,Feature Request,
"In general- designs and features are getting better, but performance is getting worse.",Complaint,
From the start it would not turn off and on properly.,Bug Report,
"Control lighting, Sonos, Dyson and Nest devices and am addicted to voice OS.",Feature Summary,
"Sub-standard and spotty voice recogntion, no audio out, small screen that adds little and is too tethered for family video calls.",Complaint,
"Update:  I'd really love it if Amazon would allow multiple devices to stream their music, because this can't happen I will not buy another Dot or even an echo.",Feature Request,
"I use it the most for time, timers, stopwatch, weather, shopping list, music and to find my phone.",Feature Summary,
I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night.,Feature Summary,
"If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.",Complaint,
But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.,Complaint,
"this dot, however -- cannot get it connected.",Bug Report,
i'm not the most tech savvy... therefore enlisted my brother-in-law AND son on different occasions... and neither could get it connected.,Bug Report,
I love my Blaze and its interface.,Praise,
It was easy to sync it with my existing app.,Praise,
"Don't get me wrong, the Blaze is cool tech, but the reason I upgraded was really to be able to get email and text notifications on the Blaze.",Feature Summary,
"It does provide that option, but it's really more annoying than useful.",Complaint,
"I can read texts on the screen, while email notifications are just the sender and subject, which is fine.",Feature Summary,
"Call notifications are helpful too, but a lot of the time when I get a call notification, my Blaze doesn't start buzzing until the call has already gone to voice mail and by then I've missed it.",Bug Report,
"But, my biggest disappointment is that the text/email notification option is pretty much useless because the Blaze doesn't differentiate between new notifications and ones it's already given me.",Complaint,
"So, I get some notifications and acknowledge them by either swiping them away or pressing 'Clear All,' but then when I get new notifications, all of the ones I already acknowledged come back too, so this feature isn't very useful.",Bug Report,
"You can also control music on your phone (start, pause and stop play), and I use that occasionally.",Feature Summary,
"On the positive side, the step counter is fairly accurate and the software is useful.",Praise,
I even enjoy changing watch faces from time to time.,Praise,
"The manual that comes with it doesn't really tell you how to shoot movies or to take pictures, but I guess that's true with most cameras.",Feature Summary,
"Pros: small, takes great videos, HD, good for shooting outdoor activities Cons: gets hot, freezes when trying to watch videos directly through a TV, once I downloaded videos to my laptop, it converted to mp4, which isn't compatible with the GoPro Studio, the camera only takes wide or medium angle photos, large learning curve for me (could be cuz I'm old), so it took some time learning the buttons and using all the different settings.",Complaint,
"She loves the text message options, she gets the entire text on the screen of her Blaze.",Praise,
"For some reason, the iMac did not recognize whether the Blaze's Bluetooth was turned on and the Blaze was not helpful because it kept saying log into the fitbit website for set up.",Complaint,
* It was much easier to set it up on her iPhone via the Fitbit app.,Praise,
"While the Blaze does not have all the snazzy effects of the iWatch, it does have some of the same things as the iWatch, most notably, the Blaze will notify you when you have phone calls (even when your phone is on silent).",Feature Summary,
You can also read text messages off the Blaze.,Feature Summary,
Freezes up on playback!,Bug Report,
The screen turns blue and then I have to remove the battery to restart it!,Bug Report,
"Playback interface is horrible, otherwise it seems to be a quality product.",Complaint,
DON'T BUY - until GoPro updates the firmware to support playback.,Feature Request,
I was led to believe that I could connect to my Netflix but apparently I cannot do that yet.,Complaint,
It is a watch first with just enough notification display to be great at it's job.,Feature Summary,
"Like: - small and compact - waterproof housing - TONS of settings to get the perfect shot - expandable storage - replaceable batteries - free editing software for Mac + PC - mobile app is awesome for quick posts, edits, and control - new sensor can 'crop' the video image during recording to give a traditional video camera look (instead of the fish eye) - SLOWMO!!!!",Feature Summary,
The battery lasts for several days without needing a charge and most of the apps and notifications work as you would expect them too.,Praise,
The only minor thing that actually works out in my favor is that the watch will not vibrate when recieveing a message from a group text.,Complaint,
"I actually like this so that my wrist is not vibrating like crazy when people are talking, but I don't feel like this was part of the design, but rather a flaw that kinda works out.",Praise,
I ordered this in January and have enjoyed listening to news each morning.,Praise,
"After 4 months, it started re-starting randomly during play.",Bug Report,
"It starts up, says Hello.",Feature Summary,
"When I start a request, the blue light comes on, but turns off after about 1 second, before I can complete my request.",Bug Report,
Does not understand many commands like echo does.,Complaint,
"Seems faulty, stops working and needs reset after just 30 mins of play.",Bug Report,
"However, the Dot would not pair with the receiver.",Bug Report,
"In order to pair my phone with my receiver, I had to enter a pass code into my phone.",Feature Summary,
The Dot does not have the capability to do that.,Feature Request,
Bottom line is that the Dot doesn't pair with any of my devices.,Complaint,
"Now need to get a different kind and all the connections I had set up (my fitness pal, webmd, etc) are lost or take the chance on 200 dollars for 1 year of use.",Bug Report,
Love the games and apps on this.,Praise,
Great graphics and lots of popular PS4-only games out there.,Praise,
I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part.,Bug Report,
"This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times.",Bug Report,
"Even after a hard reset, it works terribly.",Bug Report,
b) I can't have both Echo and Echo Dot streaming the same music/media simultaneously.,Complaint,
It's gotta be one or the other.,Feature Summary,
"Was really hoping this would work, so that there'd be a seamless stream of music from one room to the next as you walk around the house.",Feature Request,
She now sits on the nightstand and has since replaced our iPhone alarm clocks to wake us with a better variety of alarms (the Top Gear guys wake up call is my personal fave).,Feature Summary,
It also doesn't push notifications most of the time when you set it to do so.,Bug Report,
I can't access my call and text records and it really only keeps track of the fitness of  the watch.,Bug Report,
"It's GREAT to have the watch on and to just tap your wrist for your workout log, current workout, time, mileage, etc.",Praise,
To track fitness and nutrition information from your wrist.,Feature Summary,
Love screen....little disappointed in some of the content.,Complaint,
"Weather, music, etc.",Feature Summary,
So need Amazon Music 3.99 month to get all songs,Feature Summary,
However the screen information feeds need improvement.,Feature Request,
The drop-in auto answer function is a privacy concern.,Complaint,
One of the features I was hoping to get was the capacity to se and track local weather radar similar to to what the Sony Dash used to do.,Feature Request,
If I want to listen to radio music I will turn on the type of music I want to listen to.,Feature Summary,
Echo choices of music is no big deal.,Praise,
I doesn't do anything I want more than Echo...Maybe it is because there are no operating instructions to tweek my interest in its full capability.,Complaint,
Very upsetting that there is no way to turn off the cluttered text on the main home screen.,Complaint,
Just got off the phone with technical support and they confirmed that there is no way to get rid of the things to try text messages.,Feature Summary,
So basically you can set a background pic but can't see it through the advertisement.,Complaint,
The tips are distractin and I don't care about them.,Complaint,
They are useless in your screen and distract from the picture.,Complaint,
"(LOL)  My most recently problem involves the GoPro application for the computer (Windows 10 sucks); still working on this issue with the vendor and hope to resolve it soon because otherwise, I will not be able to work on/save my beautiful videos.",Complaint,
Very bad recognition.,Complaint,
Gets stuck listening.,Bug Report,
Understands 1 of 3 of my commands,Complaint,
"Freezing is an issue, as well as intermittent issues with not being able to record.",Bug Report,
I can't get it to sync with app.,Bug Report,
It was easy to set up.,Praise,
The main problems I have with it are the software - you cannot change or choose the information on the screen (so for example if I just want to display time and weather - I cannot do that - there is stupid stuff at the bottom like 'try X...' that cannot be erased or hidden.),Complaint,
It is complicated to figure out how to change or delete 'cards' and how to stop the screen from constantly changing (and some of the text will keep changing all day no matter what - no way to turn it off).,Complaint,
I tried playing youtube videos on it - and it does ultimately work - but it is so convoluted and frustrating on how to get the video you want - that I will probably not bother.,Complaint,
It is not fully formed yet and I found it frustrating unless you just want to listen to amazon music.,Complaint,
"The show does not seem to pick up as well on voice recognition, the speakers are not very good, getting it to play what you want on video is a frustrating chore, and dealing with the home or calendar screen is a hassle.",Complaint,
"I am a little disappointed in it, I thought it would show u-tube videos and more pictures similar to my iPhone but it doesn't at this time.",Complaint,
I am hoping that as the software updates it will show more videos and pictures.,Feature Request,
Pick up news pictures and videos.,Feature Summary,
Good product but still required further improvement on software / OS.,Feature Request,
"Integration to Smartthings, WEMO, and Logitech Harmony are fine.",Praise,
"For using in non-US area, functions related to traffic, map and location can't be properly located and used.",Complaint,
"Hard to set up: it took more than an hour because the app couldn't coordinate the bluetooth or the wifi, kept crashing or hanging.",Bug Report,
"After restarting the echo, phone and app multiple times, a google search showed that sometimes some part of android needs to be updated for the Alexa app to work.",Bug Report,
I didn't have that problem but it still took another 45 minutes to set up.,Complaint,
The alexa app is the worst.,Complaint,
It's also super annoying (and not totally clearly stated) that it's not possible to link Echos (or dots) together.,Complaint,
Quite straightforward - gives me news and music when I ask.,Feature Summary,
Sometimes it overhears conversations not intended for her ears.,Feature Summary,
There should be a cross check by Alexa saying 'Do you really want me to dial 911?'.,Feature Summary,
That would only add a couple of seconds to the response time.,Complaint,
The bit tells me just how well I slept and if I need more.,Feature Summary,
The text and phone call vibration feature is nice for those of us that keep our phone on silent and the food tracking is helpful as well.,Praise,
I wish my Pyle scale linked to the app as well but I'm still very happy with this device.,Feature Request,
"lots of bugs, glitches and problems that the company cant seem to keep up with.",Bug Report,
"lots of developers experimenting on the skill market without trying the skills, effectiveness first.",Complaint,
For some reason the Show doesn't pick up my voice/dictation as well as the Dot.,Complaint,
It's always getting words wrong that the Dot picks up fine.,Bug Report,
"If they are using the same servers and dictation software, I'm not sure why there would be a difference, but there is.",Inquiry,
"Most of the time I will ask the Show to play music and the light will come on indicating that it's listening, but the Show does not respond and the light times out and nothing happens.",Bug Report,
"The screen is cool, but there isn't much UI/UX to do anything with.",Complaint,
Since the dictation is always wrong I would like to be able to type seachers for music or youtube.,Feature Request,
"Thinking about returning it, but I've always been a fan of Amazon so hopfully an update will fix the bugs and all will be right again.",Feature Request,
It shows my calendar events and text messages.,Feature Summary,
"PROS: - LOTS of skills, including the TP Link smart devices, which work well - Asks for voice feedback and has voice training to ensure it understands you - Can work with an awesome speaker, like Bose or Sonos -AllRecipes integration, though should work better CONS: - Voice recognition isn't there yet - everyone in my family gets mad at Alexa.",Feature Summary,and Human Usability
"You  say 'Turn lights on'  and it starts playing Sara Bareilles..... -You have to ask very specific phrases, whereas if you tweak the phrasing in Google Home, it still knows what you're talking about - A lot of the awesome, obscure skills, but even without account integration, you need to enable them and remember their names.",Complaint,
"You need to remember all the specific commands for them to work All in all, for $50 it's good - but I'd recommend waiting for it to improve or trying another device.",Complaint,
"I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo.",Bug Report,
"My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.",Praise,
"We also like the 'skills', especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the 'tight pants' song lyrics which is a family favorite.",Praise,
Even on the lowest resolution {video is awesome} you will be way over the capacity of the 4.7 Gig DVD!,Feature Summary,
Even when I burnt a 25 minute video to DVD it did not play good on my fancy DVD home player.,Bug Report,
"The echo devices including the Show require a cell phone number and service to make video calls, voice calls and messaging.",Feature Summary,
This is not a stand alone unit by which calls can be made through the internet like FaceTime on an iPad.,Feature Summary,
I love all the other features Alexa devices offer but am greatly disappointed that these devices require cell phone service.,Complaint,and Praise
Cannot train it to understand my wife's accent.,Complaint,
barely understands any questions,Complaint,
Difficult to find information on features,Complaint,
"I can't believe that you can't play any ps 1 or 2 games,and not even PS3 games.You can't copy music videos pictures from a usb to the hard drive unbelievable!You can't even play the games you purchased on the PlayStation 3 store what the hell?",Complaint,

I've turned off trending topics and notifications in Home Card Pereferences and still get constant annoying messages to try this and try that.,Complaint,
I don't want to Wiki Star Trek nor do I want to ask Alexa what another word for Happy is.,Complaint,
All I want on my home screen is for it to scroll thru my own pics (and this works) and then display the time and temperature...no suggestions to try asking Alexa things I don't care about.,Complaint,
All these suggestions just clutter the screen to the point where the automatic scrolling thru my own pics looses it's appeal as I barely see the pics thru the suggestions that clutter the screen.,Complaint,

I used it for a week and then tried taking it to a new location and it would never turn all the way on (always acted like it was still 'booting up') so I thought if I took it back to where I originally had it that I would work..,Bug Report,
More functional as a fitness tool than as a everyday watch.,Feature Summary,
"Text and call notifications are nice, but not the reason I bought it.",Feature Summary,
Pros: battery - lasts ~5 days on a charge and recharges quickly; watch-based HR and sleep monitors are helpful tools in tracking overall fitness (although I'm not convinced they're particularly accurate); easy to use and understand online 'dashboard' (activity log).,Praise,
"Cons: main con is a big one for me...instead of just raising/moving the watch--or even tapping the screen--and having the face wake up, I generally (90% of the time) have to push a button just to see what time it is, how much time has elapsed in my workout, or how much time I have left; generic 'workout' tracking is questionable - I have to laugh when I mow the yard and am credited with a 45 minute 'outdoor cycling' workout.",Complaint,

"You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy) My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear.",Complaint,

It takes great still photos.,Praise,
With the simple included instructions I was easily able to get my Pebble set up and running in no time.,Praise,
"The interface is not as helpful as the original Pebble Classic, vibration is weaker, too hard to check time and date due to having to clear notifications first compared to Classic.",Complaint,
The display does not mess up routinely like the Classic did which is a plus.,Praise,
Will continue to play with notifications to drop down to a bare minimum of important ones so that the watch is more useful as a watch too.,Feature Summary,

Don't keep it paused too long or you are going back to the home screen.,Bug Report,
I haven't had any issues with this one other than it did come on by itself one night and said it couldn't find the answer to the question I had asked.,Bug Report,
The other thing is there are numerous commercials advertising Alexa now days and if the TV happens to be up loud enough my Echo will come on upon hearing the Alexa name and then it is confused about the question it was asked.,Complaint,
There are so many different things that can be asked of the Echo and a ton of music to choose from for it to play as well.,Feature Summary,

"This watch does the simple 'wrist companion' very well with good activity/sleep tracking, notifications from your phone, microphone support and a cool color e-ink display that is very sharp and low power.",Praise,
Lots of great feature too.,Praise,
My watch corrupted and is no longer usable and there's no support to help fix this issue.,Bug Report,
"Screen was too small, functionality not all there for me, limited in functions, no two-way communication with Ring app, sound quality and volume was ok...not overwhelming and deserving of the hype as described, search results were very broad.",Complaint,

Updating the software to be more customizable would be so easy.,Feature Request,
I want to be able to set up interval training and other crossfit features without buying another Fitbit.,Feature Request,

Her voice frequently cuts out.,Bug Report,

"The voice recognition works perfectly, even my 5 year old has no problem using it.",Praise,
"My wife loves how she can select music, start/stop or change volume with voice commands while she is holding our baby daughter, since she would have no free hand to do it in the phone.",Praise,
"Better battery life than anything else (except the pebble time steel), simple interface and I get all my notifications there so my phone can spend more time in my pocket.",Praise,
"I'm lowering my review from 5 stars to 3 because fitbit already made me give them an email address as part of the newest update, and randomly removed some apps from my watch.",Bug Report,
"Negative - even if you turn off all background screen notices, you cannot get rid of 'Try this' message at bottom of screen & it cuts off the background pics you'd like to enjoy.",Complaint,
Easy setup like my Echo & Dot.,Praise,

I still have been unable to setup the Echo Dot.,Bug Report,
The Iphone App still shows setup page not complete.,Bug Report,
"lights, door locks, is very limited and will not operate my brand name products.",Feature Summary,
I'd love to be able to tweak it more but the basics are indeed present... Also small learning curve for do's & don'ts to minimize heavy battery drain.,Feature Request,
For example watch faces that poll for the weather temp or have continual animation will definitely drain the battery at stronger rate than a simple analog watch face with out the second-hand.,Feature Summary,
You can't just shake your hands or wrist to get the steps.,Feature Summary,
"If you don't really care for the looks especially the watchfaces, I'd recommend the Alta HR or Charge 2 as you get the same technical stuff for the cheaper price.",Feature Summary,
Music control and Notification didn't seem to be all that great especially if it doesn't want to work.,Complaint,
The customization of the looks was bleak and the 'watch' look got old.,Complaint,
Perhaps we are asking difficult questions that Alexa cannot answer.,Complaint,
But we don't get much out of our questioning.,Feature Summary,
"Then last night, when we were in bed at 11:30 pm, Alexa started playing music at a high volume level.",Bug Report,
The free ebook on the Echo Dot didn't give much explanation on how to talk to Alexa.,Complaint,

"If you can get them working, the feed is around 10 seconds behind the live view.",Complaint,
"Amcrest in particular is bad, and unless you pay a subscription fee, you can only have one camera that is viewable.",Complaint,
"Other cameras let you have more, but the lag time is still there.",Complaint,
"I can ask 'what's the traffic' and she'll tell me how long it's going to take to get to work (pretty close in terms of timing); 'add ____ to the shopping list' - I never forget the list on the counter since it shows up on the app; 'play _____' radio station, Pandora channel, news flash - super helpful.",Feature Summary,
I love the ease of use with the updated GoPro app and the functionality of the high res video and time lapse features.,Praise,
I use the Multi Timer app and its been perfect for what i need.,Praise,
It can't replace a regular camera given that doesn't provide zoom (neither digital and analog),Feature Summary,

I've had the original Alexa since it first came out Jan 2015 and have been impressed with the functionality Amazon has added to it.,Praise,

i hope they add playing music on all echo devices at one time play the same song in sync.,Feature Request,
Wish their was an easier way to take selfies.,Feature Request,
Love the number of apps available for this.,Praise,
The main problem is that it is unreliable as it is plagued by underwhelming voice recognition.,Complaint,
Many times thinks that it is summoned even though there were no words remotely close to its name.,Bug Report,
It seems to have gotten worse with time (perhaps after activations increased and the Amazon service is too slow to cope).,Complaint,
The only problem I have is the fact every 3-4 weeks I get the SOS screen which says I need to restore the watch software.,Bug Report,
Pebble is no more exists but this watch is still the best because it does what our smartwatch need to do and for 5-6 days + when you out of battery you still can see the hour for about 12 hours,Praise,
The touch screen options are intuitive and easy to use.,Praise,
"Well, it does connect to the internet, it does respond to voice control, and it does what it says it's supposed to do.",Praise,
My hope was to set up a system in conjunction with VAUX speakers that would allow for music to play throughout my home via simple voice commands.,Feature Request,
"Alas, these don't talk to one another very well.",Complaint,

"Yes for most part it has met my expectations, except I would like to download my videos and music from iTunes.",Feature Request,
Also like to see my email.,Feature Request,
Also discovered I primarily use Alexa when I'm moving about and prefer using Alexa app on my iPhone or iPad rather than returning to Show.,Praise,

Another irritant is the delay to wake up when I turn my wrist towards me to see what time it is.,Complaint,
Once I did the update with the game...when the patch was downloaded the game would just get stuck at the opening and give no message.,Bug Report,
I tried everything a little disappointing considering the bundle was $249.00 The issue I believe is only with the game and the associated update.,Bug Report,
"Every morning, I ask Alexa what the weather forecast is and I get an accurate response.",Praise,
"Very convenient, relatively easy to configure once you figure out what you're doing...I won't lie.",Praise,

"The iHome device I paired it with shuts off after a certain amount of time, so that does me no good overnight.",Bug Report,
I had to figure out why the rings were flashing overnight (it drove me nuts at first)...it means you have a notification,Complaint,
It is heads and tails above the flex in terms of features and functions.,Feature Summary,
I have not been able to use this watch yet because it requires some sort of Pebble app with a Pebble account to even turn the damn thing on.,Complaint,
Switches off by its self everytime i play for like 20 minutesand then it asks me to report prob which i dont even know,Bug Report,

I hope amazon finds more intuitive ways to use the screen when interacting with Alexa.,Feature Request,

Installation was a snap and it connected itself to the Alexa app automatically.,Feature Summary,
"I'm sure I'll find a zillion uses for it -- so far, I think it's great to be able to actually see my shopping list on the screen and I guess I just like 'seeing' (as opposed to hearing) the weather, the name (amd lyrics) of the song that's playing and other things.",Feature Summary,
I just happened to find out about the 'messaging' feature on Echo today and it works perfectly on this and the Dot.,Praise,
"In that I happen to sit right here beside it a lot of the time, I'd like to be able to make the rolling prompts (for videos, etc) stop and let the screen just be dark -- sure as shootin' there's a setting or command for that, so I'm unconcerned.",Feature Request,

"Worked fine with my previous phone, so I know it's not operator error.",Complaint,

"At this price point, you'd expect your gear to not freeze up regularly, batteries to last for more than a few hours, etc... 4 stars simply because it is a great product...",Feature Summary,
My only critique is that it doesn't allow me to set the alarm to wake me up every morning.,Complaint,

Alexa does not answer general questions as Google Home seems to.,Feature Summary,

I have come to rely on it as an alarm (it vibrates instead of waking the whole house up with noise).,Feature Summary,

Having Alexa is actually more useful than I thought it would be.,Praise,
Having the ability to just ask a question without picking up a phone or device is great.,Praise,

"I never would have foreseen myself buying multiple but after having one I can see the use for having one on each floor of my house, as a music player, as a device for asking the weather, asking questions, setting alarms, adding things to a list, making purchases, using it to control Alexa enabled devices.",Feature Summary,
"The Show provides about half the functionality as the Dash right now, but has a lot of promise as it evolves -- especially when linked with other Echo devices.",Feature Summary,
"I read with the new update, the ps4 was backwards compatible (plays games from ps3) but it wasn't.",Bug Report,
The games graphics are ok but definitely not worth $400.,Feature Summary,

The screen constantly goes grey and displays 'Buffering...' and then the live video randomly just shuts down and the Show returns to a home screen.,Bug Report,
The one star reduction is because sometimes she's dumb.,Complaint,
"But as a standalone tool it is easy to use, easy to setup, and loud enough for a regular bedroom or office.",Praise,
"She listens to me, responds whenever I talk to her, does what I ask her, tells me when she can't do something, only shops for things I want, doesn't argue with me, gets the lights without saying she was in bed first, and doesn't want to tell me a twenty minute story about a conversation with her sister that only lasted 2 minutes.",Feature Summary,
It also has a lot of clock options and you can set alarms from the fitbit rather than having to do it from the fitbit app.,Feature Summary,
"Amazon could improve things a bit with a suggested list of commands that will work from the get go but, otherwise easy to set up and use.",Feature Request,
"The drop in feature, now in the sotware, is good but not great as, I may be wrong on this, you may not refuse a drop in by using a verbal command.",Feature Request,

You can't answer calls from the watch.,Complaint,
Can't wait for even more skills.,Feature Summary,
"I upgraded from a Fitbit HR (which died on me after six months for unknown reasons), my husband still wears his with no problems... the Blaze face is much bigger, which I expected, but not enough features to make that irrelevant.",Feature Summary,
:-( I enjoyed the clock on the face and the pulse/steps/calories burned features.,Praise,
The connected GPS is not accurate.,Complaint,
At the end of the ride I checked my Fitbit and it shows elevation gain of 320 feet and only 4.5 miles.,Feature Summary,
Another pet peeve is what's the point of the new update that allows you set set your goal to move through out the day but it doesn't have an actual notification to remind you?,Complaint,
The app tells you if you moved enough during that time but it doesn't actually remind you to move.,Complaint,
"Wish I'd bought the Home instead...Alexa doesn't always recognize my questions well enough to even search for them (with Bing no less, so not like it finds a good answer!).",Complaint,
The 'Skills' are mostly a joke.,Complaint,

"They are very distracting and unnecessary for some people, and I wish you could turn them off.",Feature Request,
"Lastly, there is no option to display a simple monthly calendar on the screen.",Complaint,
It's nice to have Alexa add items to the list and it's always on our devices when we go to the grocery.,Praise,
The traffic info is great too.,Praise,
Being able to call out 'call Donna' would provide a semblance of control and connection.,Feature Summary,
"Would be a great device, but there is a very annoying 'try this' message you can't get to go away.",Complaint,
"While you are playing music it will have something on the screen that says 'try this, ask alexa to play a game'  or 'try this, tell alexa to turn up the volume'.",Feature Summary,
Makes it look cheap and I already know these things so I would like to be able to turn off notifications.,Feature Request,

"You have to constantly repeat yourself, half the time she doesn't understand what you're saying, or she doesn't have an answer.",Complaint,

"Very responsive, hears me 95% of the time (and sometimes picks up random things from the TV), even from the other room, and I can talk in a normal voice, not yell (XBOX you need to step up your game, you hardly ever hear me even when I scream at you!)",Praise,
"Wish it was more interactive with other smart home products (like my receiver so I could change the volume on my sound system), and the shopping list worked better w/OneNote.",Feature Request,

The camera kept freezing on me and has glitches on the images.,Bug Report,

I think as more features come in to play it will be better not many of the skills are designed around the video screen right now,Feature Request,

I like the idea of having a screen but the execution is terrible.,Complaint,
Asking Alexa about those stories almost NEVER works.,Complaint,
"Other clunky interface examples: When listening to music, I like the idea of showing lyrics but it doesnt actually tell you what song you are listening to on the same screen?",Complaint,
"It was sporadic at best, glitched many times, and wasn't very adaptive at realizing what I wanted to say.",Bug Report,
Worked  great with phone connection.,Praise,
It has trouble syncing with wifi in multiple places.,Bug Report,

"Con: It is not touch screen, it does not display emoji's correctly (they look more ASCI, then the modern ones), replying to text messages does not always work and when it does Google seems to get confused as to what you said (this might be Google's fault) example would be when you say the name Cassie, it interprets it as Cathy.",Complaint,
"Also the pebble app is a real pain to setup, as it asks you 3 different times what language you want (overkill to me)",Complaint,
The Echo Dot doesn't seem to be able to give detailed answers on any of my questions and often says it cannot answer the question.,Complaint,
"According to the reviews, the Google Home is much more capable as an information search engine.",Feature Summary,

"The fact that they have small workouts to get the blood pumping a swipe away is perfect, especially since it teaches you how to do each move.",Praise,
"You are able to switch out the watch bands (something that swayed me to the flex) possible negatives: Checking texts is pretty awesome, but I wish that it was a little more interactive.",Complaint,
Bought this to use where my full Echo was having issues connecting to speakers.,Bug Report,
"My only complaint, and while it may be 'minor' to some, it is a major inconvenience for the application this was purchase for.",Complaint,
"Going through the configuration app indicates the dot and remote are connected, but it just turns on / off when trying to speak a command.",Bug Report,

The Alexa app attempts to assign features and control that does not correspond to the harmony software setup.,Bug Report,
In my case I have multiple equipments in multiple rooms and when Alexa attempts to assign functionality it has no relationship to what room associated with what function associated with what equipment.,Feature Summary,
I am working with Amazon Echo technical support to try and get the app a little more functional by allowing the user to turn off and remove some of these features that do not apply.,Feature Request,
"With the meal tracking, I taught myself what 1700-2000 calories a day looks like with healthy foods compared to bad ones.",Feature Summary,
"The Good - Great screen, nice visuals and still does everything an Echo has in the past and more.",Feature Summary,
The Bad - I feel a bit of bait & switch here because some of its coolest features like displaying song lyrics or even something as simple as having a folder of wallpapers on shuffle are for Prime Members only.,Complaint,
Reliability: I've used it in several cases where I knew my heart rate was over 150 and it registered as below 135.,Complaint,
The record of minutes and number of times restless and awake at night help me know if I need to change something in my habits.,Feature Summary,

Alexa also seems to have some difficulty finding songs in my Amazon music library.,Complaint,

Voice recognition is very good; and I think that was the tough technological nut to crack.,Praise,
"The rest (improved AI and interfaces) is easier in my opinion, and will progress rapidly.",Feature Summary,
The camera keeps freezing up even after updating the firmware severally.,Bug Report,
Easy set-up.,Praise,

Example: most of the time we use Alexa to turn lights on/off.,Feature Summary,
"water proof, apps variety, battery life), I consider the Pebble Time the better smartwatch for Android OS.",Feature Summary,

"Also is great for face to face hands free conversations, of course.",Feature Summary,

I have a drawer full of microphones and microphone adapters and none of them work.,Complaint,
"Now, for over a week I have not been able to connect it.",Complaint,
Can't use any of the features I bought the damn thing for.,Complaint,

"The watch serves its purpose, but the interface is primative.",Complaint,
"Also, it recommends downloading android wear app for a better experience, but the watch is incompatible with the app.",Bug Report,
(Same thing used to happen with watches) over all very happy it has definitely helped me try to be more active and the app helps me track my eating sleeping water intake habits as well.,Feature Summary,
"The interface is sometimes puzzling in trying to figure how to accomplish specific tasks, for example after pausing a prime video and going to the home screen, it isn't necessarily intuitive how to return to the video.",Complaint,
Maybe an icon of what is active could appear when paused.,Feature Request,
I'm sure more capabilities are in the works.,Feature Summary,
"It's so user friendly, we never have to explain it to anyone!",Praise,
It is a good product but there are some issues syncing  with the iphone.,Bug Report,
"It looses contact with the wireless network, which is located about 4 feet from the Show on a regular basis.",Bug Report,

"While it is able to do a lot, it has a very simple look.",Feature Summary,
"Pros: EXTREMELY light and comfortable, looks good, simple to set up and just as simple to use, compatible with both iPhone and android, great battery life, and I love love love that it's waterproof.",Praise,
Cons: The only cons I have is that I am unable to respond to text messages on the watch (I have an iPhone) and I do wish the screen was just a tad bit brighter.,Bug Report,
Alexa is not as smart as Google Home but she is cheaper and in this size/form it is cheap and easy to use.,Feature Summary,
The companion android app is crap though - very slow to start and not very functional.,Bug Report,
"And it can't be used to cast video or audio to chromecast, same way amazon video can't be cast.",Feature Summary,
"Amazon is loosing out by not allowing this functionality, since not many people are buying a proprietary fire stick.",Feature Summary,
Notifications does not function very well with my apple 5.,Complaint,
Reboot gets it going but then when phone out of range it quits again.,Bug Report,
The response time for any command for Alexa is quite amazing.,Praise,
But the major drawback I notice is the lack of integration with Google (there is a way to leverage AWS to connect the Dot to google and costs about $5 or so a year based on the requests you make).,Feature Request,
"I still have not figured out a way to stop the alarm, (cancel command clears out all the alarms for other days you set up to), and  there is no way for you to select which sound you want to play by talking to Alexa, (it has to be done through the app).",Inquiry,
These are two of the many issues I felt that Amazon needs to address.,Feature Request,
Voice parsing is laugable.,Complaint,
You can use the screen suggestions and have them fail.,Complaint,
Every time the freakin software is updated it loses WiFi.,Bug Report,
Update:  More failures to access the on screen suggestions.,Bug Report,

Still needs more choices and also ways to connect to other Amazon devices like Fire TV and such.,Feature Request,
"Hope they keep adding more things to it as will def get more going forward...and if price goes down a bit too of course, lol.",Feature Request,
The Amazon search engine is weak to say the least.,Complaint,
And Alexa acknowledges commands from male voices better than female.,Bug Report,
"Both works fine, with some understanding issues for complex or long sentences.",Bug Report,
"Unfortunately it cannot search on youtube and play songs from there, that would be ideal when you have crunky kids around the house with little patience for you to pick-up the phone and do a search by typing, and, then let them hold your phone, that is a dangerous thing in its own.",Complaint,
The microphone captures commands easily and  set-up was a breeze.,Praise,
So far it seems to function as the pre-release literature and publicity promised.,Feature Summary,
Set up was very easy!,Praise,
"I like  the screen that provides visuals, and I Like the ability to set the device so ALexa can suggest things for you to try as you become more familiar  with it.",Praise,
Being abLe to see song lyrics as the music plays is great.,Praise,
As the display  turns off after 1 minute it won't drain all the battery.,Feature Summary,

I sometimes have insomnia and it doesn't recognize the time I'm lying in bed trying to fall back asleep as my being awake.,Bug Report,
"nice unit, wish you didn't have to wait so long to let updates download off the servers...way too slow",Complaint,
Tried all the trouble shooting steps but it still will not find the Internet.,Bug Report,
The distance I walked didn't show up on the display when I turned up my wrist.,Bug Report,
It didn't matter how I set up the display I still had to press the button to see the distance.,Complaint,
On the Blaze the distance and time show up on the Exercise screen that displays when you flip up your wrist.,Feature Summary,
The Blaze also seems to be more accurate on reporting distance walked even indoors.,Feature Summary,
"Occasionally not hearing what was said - or not hearing it properly, and this is after voice training.",Bug Report,
"However, voice control is still in its infancy.",Feature Summary,
"Still not entirely natural language, but closer than many prior voice control technologies were just a few years ago (looking at you in particular, Xbox).",Feature Summary,

I was excited by the possibilities for this device but was disappointed by its execution.,Feature Summary,
"In particular, Echo Show often misheard me, which doesn’t seem to happen very often with my original Echo.",Complaint,
Few skills take advantage of the screen but even if they do add support the responsiveness of the touchscreen will make for a bad experience.,Feature Request,
"Much less lag, and better graphics than my Xbox One, and better games.",Feature Summary,
BUT I wish I could do more.,Feature Request,
"I wish it could display the clock bigger when not interacting, but I wish I could adjust the tilt for the camera.",Feature Request,
"Still needs work but provides a lot of functionality, once you get past the default marketing concept that underlies the first level of things it can do.",Feature Request,
"If you enable the skills you can unlock a lot of useful capabilities, from daily bible reading plans, to turning on appliances with added technologies, playing music from your uploaded library or playing iheart or pandora radio stations.",Feature Summary,
"There is much still to explore, but answering basic questions is pretty limited and hit or miss as well as reading articles from wikipedia.",Feature Summary,
Even with skills you have to be pretty precise how you ask for something like play iheart radio station wtvn radio instead of play iheart radio station wtvn 610 radio which never seems to work.,Feature Summary,
It isn't high quality for playing music but it is fine for reading applications if the room isn't too large.,Feature Summary,
Helps her to focus in on where her workouts are or are not efficient.,Feature Summary,
"The sleep monitoring function has been very telling, as she has discovered that her 'restful' periods are not as they should be, and is allowing her to seek advice in order to improve her sleep.",Feature Summary,

I like the customization available with the watch face.,Praise,

PROS:A watch with some interchangeable apps.,Feature Summary,

The overall software seems much better but the screen is so much harder to read than the original.,Complaint,
"I like being able to easily track my activities, particularly my heart rate as I am recovering from open heart surgery.",Feature Summary,
If you can't read it...... My eyes aren't that bad but I found it very difficult to read notifications on this device.,Complaint,
I set to the largest font and brightest setting yet notifications are still too difficult to read.,Complaint,
"Also, with folks talking about their microwave ovens spying on them, I was uncomfortable with always have a continious open ear in the room, often offering unwanted comments or answers to questions not asked.",Feature Summary,
"I could take some photos, not good at all because the camera began to be blocked, the screen was black and the buttons didn't work.",Bug Report,

Which it will work for the first two calls then back to square one.,Bug Report,
"It comes on by it's self when u least expect it to, it tells you that it don't know how to help you when you ask it to search for something and it also don't play all of a sermon when you try to listen to one from Ref Net, breaks up a lot when playing or it just stops.",Complaint,
It turned out that it's a nightmare to set up and just didn't deliver on picture quality.,Complaint,
"The GoPro App download was different for different iPads I had, and totally wrong for one of them.",Complaint,
Couldn't connect wirelessly.,Complaint,
"But if I see I have a notification, yet still need to take out my phone in order to be able to read it, that kind of defeats the purpose.",Complaint,
It does not allow for watchfaces to be changed (including the ones I paid for).,Feature Summary,
So far just meh... Not sure if there is an issue with mine but Alexa hears me ask for things and starts to respond and then just stops and is unresponsive.,Bug Report,
She'll start playing music I ask for and it will play a few words and then stop.,Bug Report,
WiFi signal is strong... Not sure if anyone else is having this issue.,Inquiry,
I love the looks of the watch and the features.,Praise,
