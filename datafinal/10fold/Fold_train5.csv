B0106IS5XY,2.0,"After having it for such a short period of time compared to other reviews, I think this watch should have been less than $50 than the $90 I had paid for it (at the time of purchase).",3,,,

B0106IS5XY,1.0,So I've had this for a week and the first thing I realize is the brightness of the watch is not that good that being said the color also is not very good and the size is small a little hard to see that part is two stars maybe even one star the band has a good feeling to it and paring with a iPhone 6 Plus is good I get all my texts and messages and phone calls that I can see before I look at my phone and there is no ring tones just a vibration I give that 3 stars I'm in construction so most of the apps are stupid .so I think it's a little pricey for what you get also the charger can fall off easy.you have to have pebbles on your phone so the watch will work well know it stopped pairing with my iPhone 7 plus,"1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,both complains and praise
B019VM3F2M,4.0,I absolutely love the Surge along with the band style/size and the color.,1,P,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,I did upgrade and this seems to suit my wants/needs better than my previous Fitbit.,"3,5",,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,The previous two bands had separated/pulled away at the screen.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,I  submitted my first under the warranty...then the replacement gave me issues as well.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,This band isnt connected in the same way.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,I feel it was due to my wrist being in between the small and large only size options.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,ONE downside to this band is that I'm getting color transfer from my clothing and/or keyboard so it's starting to look dingy.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,I will be purchasing some off market bands to replace it!,"1,5",C,,
B0106IS5XY,4.0,While I DO love this watch there are some obvious pitfalls.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4.0,The major one of course being that the company that manufactures and supports these watches was purchased by Fitbit and was essentially shut down.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4.0,Now while fitbit has said they will 'maintain the user experience through 2017' who can even tell what that means.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,4.0,There is no real visible support for this watch if you are in fact have difficulties with the hardware or software.,3,,,

B0106IS5XY,4.0,The only 'problem' to speak of so far is unreliable Bluetooth connection but I can usually remedy the problem by forgetting both connection and re-pairing the watch to my iPhone.,"2,5",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,4.0,"Hopefully Fitbit will find room for Pebble support within its brand, if not, I'll enjoy this watch while I can.",3,,,

B01LRLJV28,1.0,of course i returned.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,The Pebble Time works really great if you don't set the bar high (I was able to buy at $60 - and well worth the price).,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,The first day I thought I might return it - then I realized what it needs to be optimized (at least for iPhone).,"4,5",,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,I wouldn't expect much in terms of Pebble apps - but as a notification machine (with long battery life) for your wrist - it can't be beat.,"1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,Just make sure your notifications are set to show up on lock/closed screen - and you'll be set by how much you can get out of the watch just using that alone.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,My only gripe is turn by turn directions on Google Maps (and this may not be entirely Pebble's fault) - Google doesn't seem to notify the last direction (i.e.,2,,Problem Discovery,

B01J24C0TI,2.0,It's a lot of money to spend for an alarm clock and shopping list manager.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,Pros: 1) It has a touchscreen 2) more workout features than the previous Fitbit 3) The wristband is interchangeable Cons: 1) the touchscreen sometimes freezes and you have to wait a few seconds for it to start working again.,"1,5","P,C",,

B019VM3F2M,4.0,I have a flight of 16 stairs.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,"3) not water resistant (but the new model is at a much higher price) 4) after using this for a year, I can say that the battery life lasts up to 3.5 days on a single charge if you are actively using this device every day.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,"If you hardly touch this device while wearing it, it can last up to 5.5 days on a single charge.",1,O,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,I just got my Fitbit Blaze and right away there are few things I believe are more of a nuisance and can be looked into to make it more effective for its users.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,"First, there is nothing that tells you what needs to be done and I am not a psychic to know looking at a watch that says fitbit.com/setup under an arrow that I need to go online to that web address.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,A note or a small card containing step by step directions would be really helpful for users who aren't into tech stuff.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,4.0,However this gets the job done.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,3.0,"Don't get me wrong, the Blaze is cool tech, but the reason I upgraded was really to be able to get email and text notifications on the Blaze.",2,,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,3.0,"But, my biggest disappointment is that the text/email notification option is pretty much useless because the Blaze doesn't differentiate between new notifications and ones it's already given me.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,"So, I get some notifications and acknowledge them by either swiping them away or pressing 'Clear All,' but then when I get new notifications, all of the ones I already acknowledged come back too, so this feature isn't very useful.",2,,Problem Discovery,

B019VM3F2M,3.0,"I am amending my review and taking away one star, because four months later, my heart rate is suddenly being read at no higher than 89 bpm, which is know is absolutely inaccurate because of several reasons:  I can feel my actual heart beat pounding rapidly, two other devices showed me a HR of 140+, it's friggin Leg Day and nothing gets my heart pumping like Leg Day, so there's absolutely no way in heck my pulse is only 84 bpm.","1,5",C,,

B0106IS5XY,5.0,"It is an affordable, simple, and aesthetically pleasing smartwatch.","1,3",P,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,With the simple included instructions I was easily able to get my Pebble set up and running in no time.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,"It holds a charge for about 4 days (May vary based on usage, and watch face animation) and charges fully in a few short hours.",1,O,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,I am very satisfied with what I got.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,I just received my Fitbit Blaze in the mail.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,I then called the Fitbit call center to request a charger and I was placed on hold probably a dozen different times.,"4,8",,,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,The first representative I spoke with had no idea what she was doing and then she transferred me to another rep so I could sit on hold for another 10 minutes.,"3,7",,,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,Absolutely horrible customer service.,"3,7",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,Bought the GoPro for a scuba dive trip to Mexico.,"4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,It worked well through 8 dives to 85 feet.,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,Video was pretty decent with good color using the WoCase Lens Filter.,"1,5,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,Photos were not very good in general.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,"On the 9th dive, in a Cenote (fresh water cave) with a max depth of 25 feet the case flooded about 20 minutes into the dive.","1,6",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,Since I was in a cave I could not surface immediately.,4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,"So far, I have been unable to recover the GoPro.",4,,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,It is sitting in rice.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,1.0,VERY unhappy with my choice to go with GoPro for SCUBA.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1.0,Company just went out of business and sod its assets to Fitbit.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1.0,No further support for the product.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,1.0,Very disappointing.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,"The interface is not as helpful as the original Pebble Classic, vibration is weaker, too hard to check time and date due to having to clear notifications first compared to Classic.","1,2,5",C,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,The display does not mess up routinely like the Classic did which is a plus.,2,,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,Will continue to play with notifications to drop down to a bare minimum of important ones so that the watch is more useful as a watch too.,"2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,I start by saying I like the device a lot.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,The reason for the 2 star is early battery failure.,1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,I've had the device for 19 months and it will only hold a charge for about 6 hours.,"1,4",C,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,At the price I paid that amounts to over $11/mo cost average to use the device.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,"After some negotiating, Fitbit is sending me a new device as a replacement.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,"If that device also lasts the same amount of time, that will average out to over $5.50 per month.",4,,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,"I hope this one holds longer but, if it doesn't, I'll be looking for a different device.","3,4",,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,"BTW, the device did drop down to the 6 hour discharge window in a couple of days, but I did notice a slow progression over the last 6-8 months where it was requiring charging more and more often.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,"New, it lasted over a week, a few weeks ago it was down to 3-4 days, and now it's 6 hours.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,2.0,Very disappointing.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,I really LOVE this Fitbit Blaze!,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,"All the features are excellent, and the set-up could not have been any easier.",2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,"Once you download the app to your phone and answer a couple easy questions, the app syncs to the blaze pretty much in real-time.","2,6",,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,Lots of bells and whistles too.,2,,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,"I can even see my text messages on the Blaze, and it has great reminders to get you up and moving.",2,,Information Giving,

B019VM3F2M,5.0,"I've been using it a couple months now, and I just love it!","3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,"Unfortunately, it has one tragic flaw that needs to be addressed.",3,,,

B01J24C0TI,2.0,Want to set multiple cooking timers and keep them on screen for a quick glance?,2,,Information Giving,

B01J24C0TI,2.0,How about that complicated recipe you are cooking from AllRecipes.com?,2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,"Sorry, but the Echo Show is going to time out after a minute and you'll need to search for that recipe all over again.",2,,Problem Discovery,

B01DFKC2SO,5.0,This is my 2nd Echo Dot as my 1st one freaked but I had the warranty so it could be replaced.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5.0,I haven't had any issues with this one other than it did come on by itself one night and said it couldn't find the answer to the question I had asked.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5.0,The house was quiet and I hadn't said anything so that was a tad freaky.,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5.0,It made me jump a bit and say a word that is similar to poop when it started talking!,4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,5.0,The other thing is there are numerous commercials advertising Alexa now days and if the TV happens to be up loud enough my Echo will come on upon hearing the Alexa name and then it is confused about the question it was asked.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,5.0,"If I can, I quickly place a rag, small pillow or blanket on top of it or try and hit the TV mute button when those commercials start to keep that from happening.","4,6",,,
B01DFKC2SO,5.0,There are so many different things that can be asked of the Echo and a ton of music to choose from for it to play as well.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,5.0,I'm very pleased with mine!,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,5.0,"I like it, however I have not been able to enable to my contacts or message or make telephone calls, very disappointed, any help you can provide will be highly appreciated.","2,3",,Inquiry,
B01J24C0TI,5.0,"Okay, since getting this, we haven't turn on our Echo again, we love having this in the kitchen.","3,6",,,
B01J24C0TI,5.0,"Playing music, videos for the kids, seeing the time and temp clearly.",6,,,
B01J24C0TI,5.0,It's great!,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,5.0,"Sounds great when playing music, I do with the screen was slightly bigger, but for now, this is perfect!",1,I,,
B01DFKC2SO,1.0,There's no way to configure a Brazilian address.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01DFKC2SO,1.0,As my Apple account is Brazilian I couldn't find way to install the app for my mobile so I can't configure Spotify.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,"worthless will not sync with Windows 10,  Imac you need the blaze plugged into the charger and usb plugged into the imac and it took along time to figure that out given the poor tech support.",2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,I've never been so frustrated with a device or the lack of costumer service.,3,,,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,"you have to use the charging pod to sync with the mac, got this for my dad and he doesn't have a Smart Phone and doesn't want one but wants to track his exercise and sleeping, so I'll have to see what he thinks about it over time.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,3.0,"I like the design and look and hope it works out well for him fortunately he just got a Ipad air 2 which will sync wireless via the blue tooth,  but the initial set up had to be done on the Imac could not even get the pc software to download from the windows store!","1,2,4,6",P,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,to hard for us old people .have trouble with alexa just sometimes don't answer when I talk to it,2,,Problem Discovery,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,"Works good so far, just hooked my Blaze up for its first charge.",3,,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,"I took it off and stuck the bottom in first, then pressed the top Blaze button before sliding into place on the charger base, then the blaze showed the charging logo.","4,6",,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,I like this base because it seems preferable than unclicking the Blaze Watch face every time to close in charging cord.. better to just place it on a base then just pop it off an continue wearing when done charging.,"1,6",P,,
B00NIYJF6U,3.0,Makes sure you really want one before just buying what will essentially become a paper weight in you house.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,"This does everything the other FitBits do and more;  It has the few features I would want from the much more expensive iWatch (text alerts,music control, event reminders, call alert and control, silent alarms) and the display is very clear and legible.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,"Battery life is less than , say, the FitBit charge, but that is to be expected (I generally need to charge it every 3 days or so).","1,5",O,,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,"My only complaint is their proprietary charging cradle; I have to think they could fit a micro-usb charging port on the watch so you could charge on the go with  a generic cable, but instead you have this clunky cradle that is too big to carry around with you and, if you are traveling, pretty impossible to find as an accessory in an electronics store.",1,C,,
B019VM3F2M,5.0,"I'm also not a big fan of the silicone band (talk about a sweaty wrist), but again, there are a ton of aftermarket band options out there for reasonable prices.",1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4.0,I was skeptical about the video and photo quality until I actually downloaded the files to my phone through the app.,"3,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4.0,I give it 5 stars for that!,3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4.0,I've yet to figure out how to turn the screen off to extend my battery life.,1,I,,
B00NIYJF6U,4.0,I also accidentally put the camera in the wrong mode a couple times (user error.,"2,4",,Problem Discovery,
B00NIYJF6U,4.0,haha) so be conscious of that.,"1,4",C,,
B00NIYJF6U,4.0,"Other than that, it was a fantastic investment!",3,,,
B00NIYJF6U,4.0,"I went whitewater rafting, waterfall rappelling, hiking, swimming, you name it!","4,6",,,
B00NIYJF6U,4.0,It beautifully captured my whole experience and I would highly recommend purchasing one.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,3.0,"My system has a black screen problem, the visual and audio will randomly go out completely (most when i just turn it on after not using it for a day or two).",1,C,,
B01LRLJV28,3.0,"It happened a lot when i just got the system, not so much these days.",4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3.0,"I still haven't found the reason for this, however i usually plug out the HDMI and plug it in again.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,1.0,Did not like this item....have replaced it with google which I have not put into operation yet.,"3,5",,,
B01DFKC2SO,1.0,Most of the questions that I asked Echo were responded to with 'I do not know the answer to that question'.,2,,Information Giving,
B01DFKC2SO,1.0,It did work properly turning off my lights and giving time and weather....,2,,Information Giving,
B01J24C0TI,3.0,Nice I like it,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,1.0,He is so sad.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,1.0,It has done nothing but glitches up and had issues after issue.,"2,3",,Problem Discovery,
B0106IS5XY,1.0,He has already stopped wearing it and decided it was a complete waste.,"3,4",,,
B01J24C0TI,3.0,Delivery was on time and great.. the item itself  technically not happy as it is not very optimized for our region.. hope that happens soon,"2,7",,Feature Request,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,Sad this company got bought out by Fitbit.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,I almost never have to pull out my phone.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,"Text with voice reply, incoming notifications, reminders, timers, skip the song, pedometer, sleep tracker, small useful apps, and most of all 5 DAYS BATTERY LIFE!","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,Pebble had it right in what a smartwatch should be.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,Something you don't have to reach for.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,"Right there, plan as can be on your wrist.",8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,Gonna miss it...,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,"Simple, lightweight, water resistant smartwatch for people who don't need bells and whistles.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,"The build quality is solid, low power consumption and good app/phone support.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,Keep in mind the price-point for this product - e.g.,8,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,"this particular Pebble watch is not a competitor to the Apple Watch or Samsung smartwatches and you won't find the usability to match those products, however this watch is 1/3 the price and I think the value is fantastic for the price.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,"This watch does the simple 'wrist companion' very well with good activity/sleep tracking, notifications from your phone, microphone support and a cool color e-ink display that is very sharp and low power.","1,2",P,Information Giving,
B0106IS5XY,5.0,I would STRONGLY recommend third-party protection for the watch face as the metal bezel probably scratches very easily.,1,C,,
B00NIYJF6U,5.0,I replace a GO PRO 3 with this camera and I must say the difference in the quality of the pictures it takes is outstanding.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,2.0,"Returned before I received it, due to Pebble going out of business.","4,7",,,
B0106IS5XY,2.0,"Would not recommend buying one, as there will be no future support starting in December of 2016.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3.0,"She was very excited, until she found out that she needs to purchase monthly services for everything she'd like to do with the device.",3,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3.0,I think Amazon needs to be very clear up front that things like music must be purchased and that other features require special set-up which also cost money.,"3,7",,,
B01DFKC2SO,3.0,"Also, after I purchased this Dot through Amazon, I saw it on sale at several stores locally for $10 cheaper.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,3.0,Not happy.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,These watches are phenomenal.,3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,"However, Pebble was recently purchased by FitBit and all Pebble watches no longer have warranties or support.",3,,,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,Be aware of this.,"3,4",,,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,My watch corrupted and is no longer usable and there's no support to help fix this issue.,2,,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,Returned this item.,"4,7",,,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,Felt it was behind its time.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,Bought it for my bedroom.,4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,"Screen was too small, functionality not all there for me, limited in functions, no two-way communication with Ring app, sound quality and volume was ok...not overwhelming and deserving of the hype as described, search results were very broad.","1,2",C,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,"True, it's almost like all its good for is two-way with grandma and grandpa, close family, and friends...but dont' expect many of mine to shell out the $250 (w/tax) to have this luxury.",4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,"Of the 3,000 contacts between my wife and I,  about 10% own echos, 2 had a show and they were clients.",4,,,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,"Will wait till tech catches up, screen is bigger, and speakers fill the room.",1,R,,
B01J24C0TI,2.0,Sorry Amazon...I have two echos and 3 dots...this one missed the boat.,3,,,

B01LRLJV28,3.0,But the PS4 is working as expected.,3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1.0,"I thought it would work with Netflix and other tv shows but it doesn't, only YouTube which I could care less about and Amazon video.","4,2",,Problem Discovery,
B01J24C0TI,1.0,"Not really where it should be as far as tech is concerned, so this definitely needs some upgrades and should be much cheaper for now.",3,,,
B01J24C0TI,1.0,My original echo listens much better overall.,1,P,,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,I'm downgrading my original review to only 3 stars.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,Watch fell through a grate in the jet way and was lost.,4,,,
B0106IS5XY,3.0,Watch is to expensive for band to fail so soon.,3,,,

B019VM3F2M,4.0,I really like  the Fitbit Blaze but I'm disappointed with Fitbit as a company for not listening to their customers more.,"3,7",,,

B019VM3F2M,4.0,I want to be able to set up interval training and other crossfit features without buying another Fitbit.,2,,Feature Request,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,The ability to just pop the Blaze out of the frame and into another is awesome - changing from a sporty look to a casual one or a more professional look takes seconds and it looks great.,"1,6",P,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,And I don't know what I would've done without a screen protector - my wrist is constantly on the concrete or slapping against something when I work out- I have no idea how the rest of you manage to keep your unprotected fitbits from just exploding during a session =P,4,,,

B01LRLJV28,3.0,I hate console exclusives.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3.0,BUT there are some PlayStation ONLY games this gen that I'm not passing on just because I think this is a $250 crappy media machine with games that are more expensive than their counterparts on PC and a monthly subscription required to be able to do 1/2 of the things.,4,,,
B01LRLJV28,3.0,This is the most affordable way to reliably get into the playstation ecosystem.,3,,,
B01LRLJV28,2.0,"I did not like it much because I thought that the console brought with the game of Uncharted 4, can explain to me what happened, if it really came with the game or not, I would like to be told to leave the doubt.",3,,,

B019VM3F2M,4.0,Fortunately I called FitBit and explained the issue and they immediately sent a replacement.,4,,,
B019VM3F2M,4.0,The process while annoying since I wanted to begin using the FitBit immediately is why I am giving 4 starts.,3,,,

B01LRLJV28,2.0,This item would have been perfect but it almost ruined Christmas Day for my son and because this was the only gift he was asking for and when we open it the item was missing the AC power cord so he could not play it on Christmas without the cord.,"1,3",C,,
B01LRLJV28,2.0,Luckily after calling around on Christmas Day because everything was closed and I couldn't go buy one I found a friend who had one on his old PlayStation that we can use until the stores open up for us to go buy one.,4,,,

B01J24C0TI,1.0,The Echo Show is a poor substitute.,3,,,

B01LRLJV28,3.0,"I see lots of debates on it being the fans running when hot but that is not it, at least in my case, it's the BlueRay drive spinning at max speed which is noisy itself but it also vibrates the whole console causing even more noise.","1,4",C,,

B01DFKC2SO,4.0,"I am not going to repeat all the details of how you can shut of the light , play music blah blah.",4,,,
B01DFKC2SO,4.0,But the major drawback I notice is the lack of integration with Google (there is a way to leverage AWS to connect the Dot to google and costs about $5 or so a year based on the requests you make).,2,,Feature Request,
B01DFKC2SO,4.0,"I still have not figured out a way to stop the alarm, (cancel command clears out all the alarms for other days you set up to), and  there is no way for you to select which sound you want to play by talking to Alexa, (it has to be done through the app).",2,,Inquiry,

B00NIYJF6U,4.0,"The only con is the sound noises caused by the camera shaking inside the box, it could have something already installed out of the factory to avoid these shocks so I wouldn't need to worry about putting something in there to fix it.",1,"C,R",,
